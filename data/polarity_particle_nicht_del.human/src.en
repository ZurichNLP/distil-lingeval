The index had dropped even prior to the vote, but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House, the index went into free fall.
In the meantime, however, it is not yet clear with any certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the negotiations will not become hindered by some problem.

But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount, in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later, the final 350 billion dollars, if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Even in spite of these changes, the essential idea of the program, to gain finances for the buyout of bad mortgage stocks, the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages, has remained intact.
"And this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what price the problematic assets will be bought.
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant, according to Marek.
Evidently none of the other parties exceeded the four percent mark and got into the parliament.
First of all such music products not available on LPs, but also, from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it.
For some, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on an MP3 player, just as it is hard for Pink Floyd fan to accept twenty-crown headphones from a market hall.
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than merely play music, but also what most cell phones can't even do by chance.
Which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge.
Unfortunately, only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal USB connector, and on top of that, not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to which music formats the cell phone or music player can handle.
The prices are also not among the lowest.
If not, you can utilize the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones, but only in a minimum of MP3 players.
Anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive (see our selection) - music players.
It might be missing for a long time.
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance (for that matter, it would be very difficult to find frequencies).
For that matter, we don't have to go far to find examples.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group.
It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in Czechia, it won't be Mobilking.
"We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Czechia don't look very hopeful.
She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Czechia are definitely not inclined toward this idea.
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services, but also mobile ones.
On the basis of unofficial information, it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year.
"At this time, we do not think that there is space for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
But now this is a suitable argument for U:fon to not allow the entrance of the virtual operator.
This means not only the attitude of the CTO, which unfortunately in Czechia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition.
This means not only the attitude of the CTO, which unfortunately in Czechia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition.
No such contract has ever been signed, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," claimed Kristián Chalupa from the external relations department of the OPC in his answer to our question.
A statement formulated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won't surprise anyone.
But evidently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OPC.
None of the operators have a dominant position, and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
But even if we did not consider this argument, for the OPC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceeding in a strikingly similar manner.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish the extension of the CTO's authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telecommunications Act, even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation.
But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators.
Namely, they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing.

It must be added that the OPC has rather considerable power to uncover such activities, and if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with operators' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it.

When we won't be the most expensive
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in competencies in these cases suits them very well.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for OPC to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The electronic coupons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city, but in its surroundings as well.
Upon boarding, it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver, but in addition it is necessary to place the Opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register.

In the letter, Germans from Český Krumlov request that the American president not to allow the return of the "Šumava region" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but rather, as liberators," is what is written in the letter, signed "People who are not indifferent to the fate of Šumava".
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would award this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and oppugns minorities and which has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors could not sign their names was the supposed fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
You don't think - you pay!
Above all, it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and last but not least, professional drivers.

If this is not approved in the bus, the passengers must sit.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and initially they did not permit the movement of the passengers.

They are not dealing with buses much, it is more the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way," concludes speaker Hanzelka, adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office.

The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement.
For Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.
In June, Merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustainability of the Landesbanken had not yet been resolved by the German Savings Bank Association.
Ultimately, WestLB might also be split up, although, of course, that's not a solution favored at WestLB.

It's a good thing that the politician used the term `relatively,' further interjecting that the German banking sector wouldn't be spared by the crisis.
According to a news report, the government-funding bank had refinanced long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which, due to the mistrust at the markets, is no longer a possibility.
HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke said that, in the foreseeable future, the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again, however.
It's not even unthinkable that not all of the financing will be needed.

I believe that animals have feelings, as well as other modes of awareness, although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date. For that matter, we haven't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness.
As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general, however, we are entering difficult terrain, because the hardware is not compatible.
But I don't believe that.
But even if awareness was not dependent on language, it would certainly be affected by it, meaning that animal awareness, however it may be defined, would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness.
Since this network hadn't changed in the course of human evolution, they say, it might well be a cause of cross-species sensations.
In theory, I can't disagree with that, but I consider it improvable.
The neural comparison is helpful, granted: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas roaches do not even have brains.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
Just like I don't study language and awareness in rats, neither do I study their emotions, given that I don't even know if they exist.

Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric for scoring the 1-0 (1-0) with his header (11th); and the fact that a very weak Gladbach team proved unable to hit the weak Hamburg team where it hurts.

The Hispanic-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people's lives. I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and ephemeral entertainment experience," said Vargas Llosa who, also supported that "the literature has a strong impact and pushes people to be nonconformist." So he suggested the writers "not to give into frivolity" and to "take the responsibility" of their own vocation.

All a nonsense, that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it, the output would be totally negative.
It did not seem a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it should be to withdraw all things (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).

In 1999, on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing: the nucleic acid testing (NAT) allowed to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which is what previous tests were based on.

One does not yet realise, but we are witnessing right now a creeping erosion of our rights, of our liberties, and our "democracy", this word that Harper continues to brandish and that sounds hollow in his mouth.

The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution-gag (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term ...).

Brno is falling way behind in its garbage sorting, not only because people here can still only put paper, glass and plastic into these bins, but mostly because of the sheer lack of containers for this kind of waste.

U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.

Bousquet bested the Croat, Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian, Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to reduce the world record time (20.30) as he had envisaged.

IBM's company motto is to change everything, except for its values.
Its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management.

"Pepa may return home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová provided shelter for Bartošová in her house in summer, she probably had not the slightest idea of what was going to happen to her marriage.
Even if one day Rychtář and Bartošová would split up, his wife will not welcome him with open arms.
"Darina and I communicate in a completely normal way, only we do not share our bed anymore," Rychtář said for Blesk.
He claims that if Rychtářová found a new love, he would not stand in her way.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, with whom, and if she has a boyfriend.
Still, who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all (ideally, in various colour versions) in the changing rooms?
"Am I too fat?"
Not that you should stop looking after yourself, but many men are literary allergic to their partners" constant complaints about their looks.
In case you suffer from this "deviation," try to realise that no extremes are good; and that within your family, order and cleanliness should not go first.
If you boss your partner around several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Naturally, you mean well, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe, if men realised that, women would not have to boss them around so much...
However, there are tougher gossips, women who enjoy frequent gossiping and despise everyone. They are, especially within a female work team, very dangerous for their surroundings.
"I don't; want to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely among the best three," said Jágr, complimenting his center.

Tomáš Plekanec failed to score on one of their raids.
A great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovaks too) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel, as an individual, to, for example, the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from the country was necessary; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
Still, that was not all.
A great paradox we do not realise anymore is that until 1989, we could not freely visit the currently most popular Croatia, as it was part of former Yugoslavia.

For nearly five months, Czech football has had no President. There exists a risk that Ivan Hašek's successor, the head of Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which is to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, Hašek's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers, unable to agree on a common candidate.
General meeting delegates wasted their trip to the National House in Prague, Smíchov, as the negotiations remained blocked, not just regarding the election method.
No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only, or also officials given power of attorney.
This single point has been partially settled since, thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible.
The Executive Board has not been of much help either, though at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mostly preoccupied by this issue.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; that would completely deny the two-chamber concept," Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations.
There is not much time left for an agreement between the parties.
An extra flight that was to take, among others, the Vice Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure. An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch.
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the Head of Pilsen football players, Tomáš Paclík, saw a strong candidate, who would meet all of his expectations of a new Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) President, he would not even apply for the top function.
"But no such person has currently been found," Paclík said to ČTK.
In the future, he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager, not excessively connected to football life.
"I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point, they don't even want to identify themselves with Czech football."
"I don't poke my nose in what I don't understand either,' said Paclík, who gained a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of board of referees, led by Luděk Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden, though he claims that an FAČR President should be a non-party one.
"It's not ideal."
"Yet, I don't see a point in transferring my shares in the Pilsen club hypocritically to someone else, while coming back there in six months, " Paclík says.
Prior to the failed election in September, Pelta promised that if he was to win, he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means.
"Unfortunately, regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June."
"If various representations were not accepted, we would have had a President since September," Pelta said.
"It is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without," Pelta claims.
Other than that, he says he does not try to define himself against the rivals.
For a long time, he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who has constantly criticised Pelta.
Despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned, he believes that on Thursday, the delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain.
"By this, I don't mean I'd do everything on my own," Rajchl said in his interview for ČTK.
"That would probably not please many people, as it would mean hard work, not just criticizing of the work of others," he added.
Critical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidature.
"But I need to know if it has any sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every move," he explained his hesitation.
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone has a good time, not just the chosen few," Rajchl said.
"This would prevent the current situation, where there are just three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem concerning young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the Presidential fight has been joined by Pilsen club Manager, Tomáš Paclík, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win.
On the other hand, he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault.
"He wouldn't want to twist things for his own benefit," Rajchl said about his rival.
There was one thing Iris Meder could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years: her swimming costume.
She has very little enthusiasm for sport, says Meder - but in the water, it's a different matter.
Following its careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she comes from the Black Forest.

The right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered, however, is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood.
The German edition of Hürriyet also does not miss the chance to make this connection.
The authors are asking themselves why the German authorities did not think earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.

The most risk-taking bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
Axel Weber certainly had not imagined that would be his role.
UBS CEO, Oswald Grübel - a banker not only famous in Switzerland - had to go.
And he will take on the role of Chairman of the Board in May, and not in 2013, the bank announced on Tuesday.
The bank actually managed to find investors, but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined a short while earlier - a less than transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive, even its name was not disclosed.
"We would not be able to save the UBS for a second time," says banking researcher Geiger.
Swiss banking secrecy was not the same after the scandal.
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working.
He would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too, like all Swiss bankers, does business with the two major banks.
The bank, however, is not (yet) prepared to go that far.
But that will not be enough.

A solution to the problem birds, however, is far from within reach.
Experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Leer have said that rooks can no longer be forced out of cities.
"We have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities will not be solved, said Leer's mayor, Wolfgang Kellner.
The intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary. Rooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice morsel, but create tools themselves.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.

The topic is a sensitive one for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one.
The suit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to curtail widespread rape within the military, in violation of soldiers" constitutional rights.
The court papers, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces.

On the death of the MCB, in 1987, the park was placed again in the minds of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​being the Catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north-south but up (mountain) -down (sea).

Tighter to the question, Modolo believes that simplifying the Collserola valley side "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, ​​not" by a purely topographical issue.
Modolo remembers that there is already a work done by the Board of Collserola that "should not fall on deaf ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers to his profession to intervene in this project "from the very beginning."

This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature, said the specialist in chemical engineering.
Analysis of the factors that affected Serna Melina Ramirez for not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question" 'What is the book that has marked you and why? Asked ​​by Martin Murillo Gomez from the Literary Cart Let's read.
A response that the jury did not like due to the term "culturalization' and second of all for not specifically explaining how each of the cited books have marked her.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Like home', of the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was designated as princess "means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the queen."
Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
The coach of the queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me was not very noticeable, made her lose points the last day."
"The surgeries are fine, but Valley did not know how to do them.
Reality or not, the fact is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself.

Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to do harm to others" as "Some businesses had received threats' and neighbors feared" for the quality of life."

Medicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
Now, according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised, there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application, that is to say, the practice of euthanasia, or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent, or not consenting.
On the contrary, affirmed during a teleconference, Jocelyn Downie, who submitted the report, more such cases were found precisely in those countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised.
And the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handicapped persons had less value.
Regarding persons who commit assisted suicide, investigations indicate that 41% of such cases should not have been prosecuted.
They also suggest among their other recommendations, that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal.

Universal suffrage, in order to be the sine qua non of democracy, is not enough and can actually become a "tool of oppression" as once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.

There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them, because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe.
Emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on European level, which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster.
The Revolution of interests would not be enough.
Can an America weakened by crisis, lead a complex world by simple and indeed, simplistic,ideas ?
But Huntsman, who is stagnating at the bottom of the polls, remains inaudible.
But the attack is not so easy.
At the most critical point of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new "German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
"At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as high."
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45 hrs) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure, which this friendly match gave to them.
"At Lille, I am there all the year round, which is not the case of Belgium."
For him there is not a shadow of a doubt, the Selection, with which he has been at odds since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
In view of the (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica it is clear that the games are not over.
Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour, it was not able to reach this precious target, which would have consoled it.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not?
Take the test or not?
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options available, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life threatening, and opting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening.
More and more, specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it.
For the time being however their research is inconclusive.
Also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear.
"Taking a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
Also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
In our world, there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll go mad.
There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll go mad.
However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics.
While lurking in the other are the bosons, a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way): mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles" by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be stressed here, are not all such exotic bugs as you might think.
In fact not all particles, or all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
In fact not all particles, or all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a fridge.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do so have mass, while the others (such as the photon) do not.
But to date no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Remember: in the very early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work.
This sensor, although this was not at all the original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide, and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009.
This does not of course mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, actually, you never know...
"But it's still a shock, you can never be prepared for it" he adds.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia.
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients asking to die thank care-givers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Palliative Care Director with the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8% of cases.
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering.
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanise me," it means "I want to be relieved."
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is especially concerned about the role of "elected people aware of the scheme," when they were not up to their necks in the scam!
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
But I don't get worked up.
Today, this isn't the case.
In Ligue 1, would not winning the title, like last season, be a big failure?
We're not FC Barcelona!
Look at Manchester City who, for two seasons, have failed to qualify for the last 16, despite also having spent huge amounts!
Lyon and Marseille, who were no good last season, were "boosted" by the new PSG.
"The loophole used is not the protocol itself" says Pierre Noizat reassuringly, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the accounting books and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted, by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be so when Westerners become more scarce.
Afghanis paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
They have become discredited; what is more, most of them did not fight themselves.

Most of the liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling they had failed to assert their views.
Not surprisingly, the articles were for the most part voted unanimously.
Commentators were also amused that one of the only diversions of the day was expressed with regard to... the hour of prayer, some Committee members feeling that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
You won't be able to visit all of them on one trip
It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months, because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees.
These pussycats like busy places and do not refuse treats.
In addition to language, Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested.
"They are promised one thing at home, but when they arrive, they are lied to, their passports are taken, they are not paid what they were promised," confirms the Head of the Main Migrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Nonetheless, many citizens of Central Asian countries, who plan to go to work in Russia, admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good, but they can barely write in their own language.

Naturally, this is not so much their fault, but due to poverty: very few Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford even a basic education.
Their families don't even have food to feed their children, not to mention decent clothing, shoes, and supplies.
If they have no status, there will be no testing, nor any official work in the future.
Many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers, without registration, hence the extortion.
On the first day of the law's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake.
Naturally, they were not free for their owners: each of the migrants, who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them.
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates could not just be bought.
Authors of the open letter are certain that the toughening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the "black" market.
"There are so many private weapons factories now, which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market, including in Moscow," says the expert.
A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores, who wished to remain anonymous, asserts that the weapons found by "black" diggers are not being bought any more, because they're too old.
"The truth is that police are aware of everything, that is why periodically, when the crime detection rate is low, it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants," says the consultant.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I won't give him away.
The formulas are still the same, according to him.
According to Baranets, the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything.
I, the potential client, am not just buying; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there.
A typical Walmart employee, receiving 9.5 dollars/hour, cannot afford this.
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart (they're not so welcome in the progressive city, that is why they don't exist here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart (they're not so welcome in the progressive city, that is why they don't exist here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that it sells billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!
Fast food restaurants increase it with time, but very little. On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.90 dollars/hour.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them.
On the other hand, the administration does not often ease their life.
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald's by Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke out. One of them, Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's claims it sells billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!"
But only a few hundred people took part in it, and many of them were not fast food employees, which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement.
Information entry has improved (the system receives more data), but output still needs to get better.
But for this, we need to identify both the user and the space around him.
It's a popular thing, but is it overestimated?
Movements were not recorded by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles.
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment?
Of course, it would be good to have eight mega pixels with 1000 k/s speed.
It's not just the mega pixels, though, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
So it's important to remember about the resolution on the X, Y, but also the Z axis.
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased?
It is not applied to determine the object's depth.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Don't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies?
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Ironman, but to a regular person.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city all in red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
Then, the wave of older free, unofficial artists was gone, while new, free artists like me were not understood.
In our time, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different. You can be popular, but not very cultural.
Nowadays, people are judged by appearance, not their inner qualities.
Who knows, maybe you cannot shake his hand, and need to spit in his face.
Who fits the role better than I?
But 300 people will come for culture, not 10,000. In the end, there's less management, money, everything dies out.
I have fans; the main thing is not to betray them, not to spoil what I have earned.
I have fans; the main thing is not to betray them, not to spoil what I have earned.
But not everyone can be engaged in culture.
Under the right rulers everything was different. Kings may not have understood culture very well, but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts.
Even Erart, but they're different because they say honestly that we don't accept all modern art. There are some artists, who need to find other museums for themselves.
We need cultural bedrock, but we now have more writers than readers. This is wrong.
I think the choice is small.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
But it's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space.
Animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct, when they're out of their familiar environment.
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
In other words, if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural, a woman needs gravity, earth's pull.
"Then what?" - asks Valery Poliakov about this non-trivial issue.
When a body does not feel the earth's pull, it does not form the skeletal and muscular system.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training, as they do with adults.
"The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, commenting on the current situation.
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed?
"The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce," asserts Kala.
This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided.
However, just because we have reduced the order limits, does not mean something will be procured.
That is certainly not true, but again, I prefer not to make such comparisons.
That is certainly not true, but again, I prefer not to make such comparisons.
If that were not the case, they would gain nothing from working with our office, would they?
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet.
A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "too constrained" and will not be enforceable.
I do not think this is the way.
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not penalise those, who make a mistake on a technicality, which does not affect the final decision.
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not penalise those, who make a mistake on a technicality, which does not affect the final decision.
Let's see where this dead-end takes us.
The Law must be set out one way or the other, and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce.
He may say: "Let us change this law and relax it," but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there.
Snowing in the region has stopped, and only a thin layer of snow remains in the lowlands.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world, we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet, when we, one day, hand it over to our children.
Of course, for the grand finale, as long as the world does not end beforehand.
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors, so we try to provide this for them in this way.
Your international plans are not modest; you have already performed, for instance, in Madrid, Brussels, London, and Moscow.
It is not as scary as it might seem at first.
Obvious things, such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts, are not commonplace there.
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life, in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead!
We realised that work, which goes on unseen can be like it never existed.

I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something, it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole.
Polish boffins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War, but were not always met with understanding.
It is not even clear, whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar or to slow it down.
The rocket, with a ceiling of 1800 metres, measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg.
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-out centres for the poor, who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages.
Liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin.
Private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy.
Thereupon, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence, or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country, for its own selfish ends.
Real power does not come from the people as the Western-style constitutions claim, but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests.
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole.
The outcome is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms.
"Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," from Sting's Fragile, where one of the main verses from the refrain is "Lest we forget how fragile we are."
We must accept that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation's lifespan.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered the puppet master (whether someone else stands above them, I am unsure, but I would not rule it out) - the Rothschilds.

Not much is written about them.
They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stake, they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained, but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government).
The first war was to remove the large monarchic state bodies in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially from Great Britain, and the third will reduce the world's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury, and will not use up so many resources), the creation of one universal faith (ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution), and finally the seizing of absolute power.
These solutions are false, however, and always lead to a worse situation (vide establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated).
The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unsubstantiated, with German capitulation (the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia) and the central European powers of Austria-Hungary were subsequently dismantled.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but on an international level (just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel).
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah overboard, because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries.
The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, could not be achieved.
The derided actor has become a respected director, and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments.
It is also Affleck's first picture, which does not take place in the director's hometown of Boston.
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail-biting scenes for the film.
What little there is, is worked well, with some occasional embellishments to reality - these do not all come off so elegantly (the scene, where a looming crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America, followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-fetched).
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm; their characters deserve more room, and are not by far the only ones in this film.
One possible prize-winner in the poll may be the last year's EU regulation according to which inflatable balloons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision.
Fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU, who holds an official post, may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece, and instead the acronym FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) should be used.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, however, but from Prague.
Emotions flare among Czechs when, just as other countries in the Union, the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products, in which it does not always succeed.
The appellation of rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar, and not sugar beet.
This is not about me being a senator or president.
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years, thieves roaming about there and people's taxes and retirement age increasing.
When I see something I do not like, though, I try to find a solution to change things.
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this?
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swear in the pub or at the television, but that we trample anyone, who wants to try to change things.
Are you not confirming this with what you have stated?
You will not last long in politics with that.
I will try to make things progress, but it if does not work out, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
I put myself forward, because people are really discontented, but now I have my doubts.
Sixty percent of people did not go to vote, and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment.
I have not considered it yet, because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background, nor the money to do it.

This does not inspire much confidence.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme.
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign.
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold?
This depends on the rate of pay.
The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg (literally "book mountain") - 2 photos
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would expect to find a dairy plant, has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture.
At the end of the 500-meter-long journey, you are rewarded in the Literature Café, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
"You would hardly believe it, but this building, in spite of the many glass panels, is a showcase project in the area of ecology," said Trouborst.
This was, for the time being, to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items.
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
At the same time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, yet this is something that they are not accustomed to.
Therefore it must be careful not to affront the public, but also the elite in the Arabic countries.
However, I wouldn't want to ascribe too much weight to this. This is not an entirely one-sided relationship.
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly.
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahu's policies.
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case.
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position.
This is, of course, no simple task for Germany, on account of its relations with Israel.
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role.
This does not make matters simple for the Germans.
This is actually the same old problem: one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing, yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum, so who is filling the gap?
Even if they do not like it, even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Nonetheless, it is enjoying protection, provided the actual creators of the names do not sue.
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights.
This is something we missed ourselves, as family names cannot be protected in Germany, said Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, rather foreigners should also register "everything" that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well," said Wentzler.
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005, the Choir visited the village, but first and foremost, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well: food, clothing, education.
Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany, the money all adds up.

This is the home of the Caucasian people group, the Talysh, of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and live long lives.
The small town is bursting with overpowering architecture from Soviet times, which doesn't fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
The fabulous wealth, for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank, has not yet arrives here in the province.
However no birth certificate exists to confirm this.
However the notion that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either.
My whole life I have never once bought groceries in the supermarket.
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion.
However, Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a Doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save.

Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, prosecutors contend
"They would write down 'no issues' (after discussing the concerns), and it didn't necessarily mean I didn't bring something up," Manning said.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier.
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night, he said they would wake him to roll back over.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself but hadn't done so.

But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere.
And even though we may now be living the American Dream, having gone to good schools and taken good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that it's the American Dream we're living, and not the Mexican one.
Our identity might sometimes be fuzzy, but our loyalty is clear.
Besides, we're aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that isn't sufficiently Mexican.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And we wouldn't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless.
That's not going to happen.
And, with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a great country.
If at least some Mexicans aren't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that.

The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air, and, like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil.
Despite killing some of its leaders and bottling up Gaza's 1.7m people in one of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America.
If they really ran the West Bank, would they not fire rockets, just as their compatriots have done in Gaza?

And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days, we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
Not so, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity."
What separates boredom from apathy, he said, is that the person is not engaged but wants to be.
On the other hand, when you're doing something dull, "such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line, distracting music can help you not be bored."
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests, I don't have time to do everything."
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the boredom percentages now, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
Sometimes no, because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it, research shows.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
Your kid doesn't just learn to entertain himself, but gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of it.
"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
On Nov. 21, Chief Oates in Aurora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older, and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes "effective immediately."
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts.
The county's district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported that decision, but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases.
"I do not think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple.
"They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don't really accept that this is legal," he said.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
"We don't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a City Council member.
We're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.

He was hated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers.

Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but, to this day, hides behind an ill-deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.

The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also recalls the couturier's charisma.
The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless" says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg looks after her couturier gowns with "the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress, it's also the many memories that go with it."
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there, at snail's pace, keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice.
There, his wage was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason which, in Indonesia, is as overriding as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I've brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to save costs, nor has it provided any equipment for the porters, who work for themselves and by the kilo.
"This work is for animals, not people" protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.

Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.

But the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly.
So why are Singaporeans not having children?
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised, especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating.

"I wouldn't upload my deepest secrets in a post" says Jorge, aged ten, when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, with which he has had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, I'll tell my mother, but not everybody" he says.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or that belongs to somebody who's doing something stupid" he says.
"I don't know if they answer me, I only upload them" he adds.

The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian Government.
The Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but this was Humala's statement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Paraguay, which was suspended by UNASUR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo, was not involved in the meeting.

Infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed, with a higher life expectancy for non-drug users: up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD4 count.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, asked with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers, counsellors, pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex, said the speaker.

It is not about paying for their beers or motel fees, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration.
An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as for each registered case there are around 4-5 people who do not know they are positive.
Ratified by a United States court of appeal, a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles.
Secondly, the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote, with the debts the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency, the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved.
In fact, the Vitro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
Should this fail, an appeal for review by a higher court, in this case the US Supreme Court, will be filed.
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexicana Airlines against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of mismanagement, dormant for several months, the Airline Pilots Union Association already found the bottleneck.
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, and the matter has already been archived.

The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.

"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."
"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.
While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.

Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.
For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.
"There is no such thing as absolute protection, but we can attempt to make a relative improvement," said Häußler.
Among others, the question was raised as to why embankments and detention reservoirs are no longer planned to protect the location.
However, Häußler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flood protection, and these must not be confused.
The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.
You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.

"However, it will not merely be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but rather a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which now consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law, and further held that the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.
The government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syrian airforce base
Unsure, the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, press agency Reuters has also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack, but was not sure.
In any case, a spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said: "We are not commenting on these reports".

Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.
The USA have not changed their position regarding the former US Secret Service employee Edward Snowden.
Following a recent meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the USA not to continue to threaten him with prosecution.

Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent
The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.
Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.
Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.

Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.

"Many citizens will not yet have noticed that red dots indicating a Sunday post collection are still to be found on many post boxes in the town centre and its districts.

Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.
It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.
It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."
And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.

Her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in Stuttgart, with plenty of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.

NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.
Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.

Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.
Furthermore, when the Hauptstrasse is blocked, the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel, argued Haas.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck.
Because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are, the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be consented to, argued Haas.

Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.

The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.

"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.
But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.

It's not life threatening.
You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I'm gone for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
When I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn't going to become old.

For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that aren't seen as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asked.
To her, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live the combined reality every day.
To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don't trust white women.
We haven't done a good job.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have those [traditional feminist] platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control?" posed Mitchell.

Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.

Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.

The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
That's not to say there won't be effects, however.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.

Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.

My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.

It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.

One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.
This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.
