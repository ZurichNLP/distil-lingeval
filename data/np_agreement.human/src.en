According to the first preliminary results of the early parliament elections in Austria have brought about a perceptible weakening of both parties in the present large coalition and a significant boost for the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current head, Wilhelm Molterer, is being severely jolted, suffered particularly great losses.

According to the preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, however, it has lost 5.5 percent of votes since the last elections in 2006.
These are the worst results of both large parties in Austrian post-war history, and particularly for the People's Party, who urged the early elections, it is literally a catastrophic result.

Battery life also decides
No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navigate in some cases.

Of course, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but very few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adaptor.

If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while, perhaps in the tram, any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough.
The MP3 can handle all of them, and in fact, most of the music you will get will be in this very format.
It one of the most widespread formats and in addition to it, the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Better cell phones, at the same time, enable the purchase of music on-line.

Even the least expensive cell phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for replaceable memory cards (of the type M2, microSD and the like).
With the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported.
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the most advanced in the field.

First virtual operator to arrive in Czechia this year.
The mobile market in Czechia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bureau, who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union.
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bureau, who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union.
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle.

Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to pretend that the Czech market is extremely competitive.

Over the course of merely half a year, this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator.
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns, among others, U:fon, stands behind Mobilking.
The advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group.
That is, they do not carry the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.

In this way, virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer inexpensive calling and text messages, which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services, though.
That's how, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group.
"Real men choose Mobilking - the operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual operator.

More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," said Jana Studničková, speaker for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
For a longer period of time now, the GTS Novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the area of corporate clientele.
We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.

On the basis of unofficial information, it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year.

In the meantime, however, its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence.
Compared to other markets, the Czech market is very specific.
No subject has approached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area," claimed Vlastimil Sršeň from the public relations department of Telefonica 02 in a statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market.

The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition, it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, make this entrance easy for such a competitor?
The tug-of-war surrounding the creation of U:fon attests to the fact that when something is important to the operators, they are able to pull for the same team.

In truth, the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile operators that is implicit in their reactions.

At the same time, complaints from a series of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) demonstrate that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators.

At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
The trick lies in the fact that, in relation to the operator, the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SIM cards.

The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such advance sales.
"If the cases you are talking about were to occur, this could be a violation of the contract conditions, which we would investigate, and it could culminate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem.

Namely, they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to potential problems: "The law enables such speculation, nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
It must be added that the OPC has rather considerable power to uncover such activities, and if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with operators' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
As mentioned already several times in this article, the entrance of the virtual operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
Either through formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, and others continued in its footsteps.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs have been tossing the whole case back and forth like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in competencies in these cases suits them very well.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the behind-the-scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon, the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again.
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for OPC to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe.

Even though the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that their displacement from the country would be discussed, almost none of them admitted this possibility at all.
The famous journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, also confirms this.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, tens of other Czech Germans went to him so that he would teach them Czech.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war envisaged being displaced from the republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.

He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all of the (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
"Whoever wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs, like what happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and tens injured.

"I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan Heights," he warned.

It's not the first time that the name Deka Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolidation.

One of them is marking the way by tying yellow caps to trees, signs and even to campaign posters of a political party that's popular in Bavaria.

The real-estate bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from Munich, which is listed in the DAX stock index, is receiving credits in the billions from a consortium of German banks in order to be shielded against the market turbulences.
An individual close to the proceedings told Reuters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total.
Hypo Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using, they said.

Sylvana is familiar with the term from reading manga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan.
`First day at school in Japan.
The way to school alone gave me the jitters.
I live at the edge of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and the train ride to Tachibana High School is 40 minutes.
I had to find the way on my own, and luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of class isn't organized as strictly as back home in Lower Saxony.

I'm not someone who likes to talk in front of other people, mind you, let alone a class of 40.
In this attire, I stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is a week from now.
At that moment, I was very glad that I'd been learning the language for two years already.

In a dramatic campaign, supporters had made desperate attempts to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar plan's merits.
Barney Frank, one of the main Democratic negotiators, had called on representatives for approval, even though it was an unpopular plan.
`It's hard to get political approval for the prevention of something that hasn't happened yet,' he conceded.
While the vote was still underway, the Dow Jones saw a drop of more than six percent, or 600 points.
It was caused by investors' worries that the government bailout might fail.

In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a selection of responses to the question, `What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?'
As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general, however, we are entering difficult terrain, because the hardware is not compatible.

There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subjective experience onto animals.
For one thing, those circuits almost always involved in human awareness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to the part it plays in short-term memory and executive and control functions).

So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates.

If you have something that, being internal and subjective, can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analyzed according to our own experience, then its study comes with significant challenges.

Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is triggered in a brain that's aware of its own activity.
What we call `fear,' consequently, is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its effects, such as physical reactions) is using virtual memory.

From that perspective, feelings are closely tied to those regions of the cortex which are unique to primates, and humans in particular.

In contrast to this, Antonio Damasio supposes, for instance, that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations. Jaak Pankseep says something similar, but his focus is more on the brainstem.

Since this network hadn't changed in the course of human evolution, they say, it might well be a cause of cross-species sensations.
The neural comparison is helpful, granted: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas roaches do not even have brains.
But is the brainstem responsible for emotions?
And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (since human awareness is based on specific circuits and on language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.

According to market research firm GfK, there has been an increase in bookings during the autumn months as well.
Travel agencies had seen an increase in turnover of approximately eleven percent for October versus 2007, the DRV said.
The results are based on the figures of GfK, which processes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies every month and uses them to make projections for the market as a whole.
Due to a weak dollar, especially trips to the United States were in demand, the DRV said.
In this area, bookings had increased by approximately one third, it said.
In the light of increasing energy and food prices, their cost was `more calculable for clients than that of individually organized vacations,' said Laepple.
Because the summer months had been very well-booked, as well, there would be another increase in turnover versus the previous year, he said - although another survey reports that the number of travelling Germans sank compared to the previous year.

Following years of increasing rates in the hotel market, rooms have already become cheaper in many places.
The trend was most visible in Paris and Rome, the survey says, where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago.
American Express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this, as it results in a `decreasing desire for travel among American tourists.'
With an increase of 26.3 percent, hotel rates in the Norwegian city are holding the record for Europe, even.

Flight rates were also still trending up in the first quarter.
Due to the increasing cost of kerosene, economy-class travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more on average than in 2007, while rates for more fuel-intensive long-range flights even went up by as much as 29.2 percent.
The rates of domestic German flights were halved even, a survey says.
On the one hand, the sudden drop in rates was the result of the slowing economic growth, the company says.

Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Coach-in-Chief, Martin Jol.
The latter's order is likely to have been a similar one: Get me goal number two!

Turkey's widening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, maybe just 20 steps into Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial ambition.

After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and had missed a week of training.

But this criticism hardly diminishes the greatness of Gebrselassie's skill as a distance runner.
Paced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04.

The show will be on stage starting from today, 20.30pm, at the theatre Lope de Vega.

If we follow the example of yesterday race, I just say no!
They called it the "perfect race" but in my opinion it was by far the worst I witnessed.
All a nonsense, that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it, the output would be totally negative.
The nonsense began with the collection of the back number, which presupposed you went there before the race.
It did not seem a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it should be to withdraw all things (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
Is it to blame the crisis if they bought only small T-shirts, made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive?
Well, these things were nothing if compared with the day of the race.
We had to go very early to collect the chip but the queue was 15 minutes long and, furthermore, you had to deposit your backpack.
We had to go very early to collect the chip but the queue was 15 minutes long and, furthermore, you had to deposit your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where you expect more than 11,000 people.
Then, as expected, the race started when we had not even handed over the backpack, although, once succeeded, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting longer than 40 minutes, which went along with a kind of popular rebellion and an attempted assault to stand.

I believe we will be around 500 people surely with pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, not even resulted in the proper arrival order because of the chip, which, I suppose, did not record the arrival time properly.

In addition, all engines are pretty new in this second generation of cars.
Both mechanical systems will include the i-VTEC technology which permits a lower fuel consumption, produces less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes the mechanical refinements and, at the same time, maintains high torque engine in all its phases.

This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step to project technologies for the prevention of collisions.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific Research and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general director of Public Relations for the Technology, Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an expansion of the Security Shield of the four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles produced by the company.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval personal space that is very similar to the Shield of Security developed by Nissan.
But the most important element is constituted by the bee's compound eyes, which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees angle, allowing the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space.
But the most important element is constituted by the bee's compound eyes, which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees angle, allowing the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space.
To recreate these visual features, engineers developed what they defined a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects obstacles within 2 meters and a radius up to 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board that immediately allows preventing the collision.

"When detects an obstacle, the little robot imitates the bee's movements and change direction immediately by turning the wheels at a right or wider angle to avoid the collision.

This is a benign alteration of sleep, defined somniloquy.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (just once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or on a more regular basis (every day, once a week, once in the month ...). The day after the child does not remember anything.
In any case, this phenomenon is not researched that well.
Even its intensity is extremely variable.
In case the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and possibly, a specialist should be consulted to check if the abnormal state of anxiety is due to any question, thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings.

The psychology of overbidding: what do we spend more money on?
The psychology of overbidding: what do we spend more money on?
At an auction, the customers tend to spend more money on a product and overvalue it.
The neurologist and economist researchers of New York University managed to disclose the neurological-economic basis of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behaviour.
The research aimed at mapping the neurological scheme of this "game" with the help of experimental auctions.
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which overbidding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called striatum, situated under the cerebral cortex, was coming into operation upon the person's defeat.

Hepatitis: when shall we turn to a doctor?
Although the number of the Hungarians being infected by hepatitis can reach 100 000, only 7 000 of them are treated properly. The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected.
Hepatitis is a collective name of different infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms, depending on the type of the pathogens: hepatitis A and E travel through the alimentary tract (for example with infected food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and the other viruses are carried in blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal mucus, saliva).
Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against viruses A and B by vaccination; but there is no vaccination against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear 2 or 3 weeks after having eaten the contaminated food; they are accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal problems, nausea.
The next sign is jaundice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye. Additional symptoms are: light coloured faeces, dark urine. Recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks.

Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness since the pathogens destroy the liver cells over a long time, thus in many cases the first symptoms emerge 20 or 30 years later.
Currently, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C is around 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease can be recognized by routine laboratory testing, it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed.

The bank will certainly sell some part of its stakes, especially the insurance activities, which it purchased from the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares started to plunge deeply last week, then in the second part of the week signs of a serious crisis appeared at the company.
Analysts agree that the bank - with its 85 000 employees - is too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The shares of the bank fell by 12% on Friday, which is the record lowest level for 14 years.
The value of the shares has been dropped by two thirds since January.
Considering the current stock prices, the entire market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion. However, company directors say this does not reflect reality.

To be exact, a sparking object providing electric shock was attached to the left hand of the volunteers in the experiment.
The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the believers would enter a sort of religious state of mind. Da Vinci's painting was selected because of its similar style and calming nature.

The Catholics described the situation as "safe" and "protecting" which made them "relaxed and peaceful".
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - comparing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of Leonardo's work.

According to the Google-chief, the company - after having subverted the entire world in the last 10 years - is still at the beginning of the road towards the ability of treating all the information.
Answering the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like "What shall I do tomorrow?" , or "What type of jobs suit me best?". However, software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient.

One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications. Furthermore, the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - comparing to the official software giant's practice - looks more available, youthful and cool.

Web 2.0 is about a collaboration to intentionally leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels. Though the degree of this act can be various, depending on the user, the main point is the same: we show ourselves to the world.

If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply just wants to bypass Google's monopoly, it is also possible (e.g. using Scroogle, which also applies the Google search system but purposely leaves no trace behind).
The number of those intentionally not registering to social networking sites is significant. This way they can avoid being discovered, Google's online applications from text editor to image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever.
General public is looking forward to seeing what is still hidden by Google.
The company - with its value of USD 156 billion - is worth more than IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion). In addition, the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever-increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software developers a serious headache.
Finally, the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sci-fi writers of the next generation.

The suspect of the double homicide committed in Ózd - a 23-year-old local man - was taken to preliminary custody on Sunday.
He is accused of having committed premeditated homicide against several people, for the sake of gain.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old young man owed significant amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not intend to pay back the debt, so he drew his creditor to a suburban establishment of Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information of MTI, the young man was determined to commit the crime, which is evidenced by the fact that he had previously hidden a gun at the premise for this purpose.

Intelligent car imitates the flying of a bumblebee
What could be a better way to advance the development of crash prevention technology than to mimic nature's obstacle detectors?

In a surprising project that is in progress at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebee has given engineers at Nissan a strategic hint at how to design the next generation of crash-avoidance systems.
Based on joint research with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C-type Biomimatic Car Robot Drive. It is a robotic micro-car that recreates bee characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents collisions altogether.

This device detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is instantly translated into collision avoidance.

It takes just a fraction of a second to detect an obstacle, and the car robot instantly changes direction mimicking the movements of a bee by turning its wheels at the angle needed to avoid a collision.

The latter is but only one example of the changes, of the big changes, that the current economic earthquake perhaps heralds or allows to be perceived: not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here.
Both in the USA as in Europe the crisis seems to act as a catalyst for phenomena which have been in incubation for some time and which in the new climate have solidified and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the bringing back up-to-date, the extraordinary re-launch, of the twin category state-sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-nationalisation of the economy.

In other words the crisis appears to be economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively a national problem.
And they possess likewise the necessary means, and the legitimate reasons to use them: two resources of incommensurable value, under certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dispose of in an analogous measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the statal-national element is after all perfectly tuned with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attribute to a coefficient that is very closely connected to that element: territoriality.

USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's almost funny to see how Barack Obama, reputedly the wisest president, is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor, having himself considered him to be the most foolish.

When he finally came out with his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush's Iraq scenario three years earlier.
It's not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words "just like in Iraq", but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush's declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration:"The new way forward".

While three years ago he himself criticised Bush's idea to send fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in Iraq as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".

Starting January, vaccinations against pneumococcus will radically change ingrained habits.
But some are saying that compulsory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak.
Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak.
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum price for vaccines to be paid for by health insurance companies.
Experts are now clear on how to proceed with the vaccinations.
The condition is that they have not received any prior vaccinations.
Anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-vaccinations.
The first batch of vaccinations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old.

The youngest children require four vaccinations.
But they save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need.
Subsidised vaccinations were introduced as part of the Janota package.
Besides the Czech Republic, around 40 countries have introduced general anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children.
Will vaccinations be compulsory?
The head of the Nahlas civil association, Rudolf Kalovský, says that compulsory vaccinations would be better.

I think this is the route we have to take, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination system.

The anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are a milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment, explains Cabrnochová.

However, practising paediatricians are concerned when it comes to buying the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations.

Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of extra taxes would fall upon the top 5% of earners.
Treasury minister Stephen Timms denied the tax rises and spending cuts outlined were a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the turn of the year.

AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate—and are integrating—into one of the continent’s most avowedly secular societies.

As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground.
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them household names, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
Conservatives are suspicious of the very idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviews tend to be at odds with their Salafi counterparts—advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia—who nowadays have a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Mr Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
He questions how far French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely guards laïcité) are really committed to pluralism.

If it is us, I would want somebody to do the same for me so I'm just trying to show respect.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred gravesites at Arlington Ceremony.

The Worcesters also founded a non-profit, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event across other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pa.

Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career military man.
It's like visiting a family gravesite.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked across the cemetery's expansive lawns and hills.
Volunteers targeted older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the war in Vietnam because they are not visited as often as newer graves, organizers said.
The mood was upbeat as children played and couples held hands while carrying the fresh pine to the graying tombstones.

The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the section but the somber mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals openly wept, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the frigid air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones while others bowed to see small black and white place cards pushed inside wet mud for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers wiping tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the gravesite of Marine Gunnery Sgt. David Shane Spicer who died in combat in July.

Consular officers with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, though under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for nearly anything under the claim of "dangerousness."

The new U.S. policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will reciprocate.
Cellphones and laptops are legal in Cuba, though they are new and coveted commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cellphones just this year; they are used mostly for texting, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would eat up a day's wages.

An activity that in any other open society would be legal -- giving away free cellphones -- is in Cuba a crime, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a tough report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, Same Cuba," a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.

Pakistani authorities on Saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt that is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.

As a result, they were marooned for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a terrorist haven.
That's why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.

The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who can be trusted.

The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
But they are also considered enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value.
If you're trying to sink someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is one that has become far more Web-based.

Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate from the negotiators working inside the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters said as many 100,000 people joined in the event, but police estimated the count was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists set off small explosives near a group of government buildings downtown.

On a day when little happened in the U.N.-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked across the city holding banners in English saying "There is No Planet B" and one in Spanish declaring, "The Earth is Saying, 'Enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native country of Peru made me aware of the heartbreaking issues the country is dealing with due to the impacts of climate changes that are already occurring."

According to one bystander, who asked not to be identified because he is involved in the climate talks, activists sporting masks and black outfits set off several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is nearby several ministries.
They were lobbing them by the buildings, he said, adding they began as flares but were followed by "a couple big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.

When asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "Because the venue is large, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He observed that whether the march was hurting or helping depended on one's perspective.

The average scores of white D.C. fourth-graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers' rose just three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
African American progress in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dipping a statistically insignificant one point, from 245 to 244.

The picture across a six-year stretch isn't more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP in the District was given, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely narrowed to 58.

Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the gains celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were propelled largely by white students who are already high achievers.
It would suggest that we've raised the aggregate by treating those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and troublesome, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in the District.

But what's scary is we're not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, targeted to students in the upper elementary and middle school grades who didn't master the basics of reading early in their school careers and are significantly behind their peers.

Others say that the NAEP's results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still provide the additional money and resources for low-performing schools that will be necessary to narrow the gap.

So the targeting may yield political repercussions that go against that important agenda.

The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud wheeze.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped off and blinked for a moment at the white columns, brick facades and emerald lawns.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Yet as she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition runs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of awestruck visitors than of enthusiastic prospective students.

An apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall.

They were driving in a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official with Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
They were driving in a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official with Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally demolished bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the victims' identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner who ran the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was engaged in plotting throughout the world, said one senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.

Given his central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly through al-Qaeda's ranks and was well-connected with other extremist groups in the region.

If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar strike killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top operatives.
The tempo of strikes by CIA-run drones has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a tally by the Long War Journal, a Web site managed by a nonprofit group.

The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.

Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that donate to the Afghan mission, saying it would increase their confidence that their money is being properly spent.
Eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome U.N. hiring regulations undercut his ability to bring in talent.

The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and disincentives" would be needed "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer enormously" from sanctions.
In a statement Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, Iran's stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think, has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iranians, Gates said.

In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless and unfounded allegations" Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."

More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average birthrate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect, according to the U.N.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birthrate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that fertile couples need to have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future."

Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
Almost overnight, posters directing families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
The response has been underwhelming, family planning officials say.
Although officials in one rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban districts report no change.

Huinan township, with a population of 115,000, for instance, is still receiving just four to five applications a month.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want more children.

People in the West wrongly see the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just some policy.
It is money.
For the dual-career, middle-class parents who are bringing the birthrate down, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.

The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation.
The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation.
Still, Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei said America's top climate negotiator was either lacking "common sense" or being "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.

Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it's not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.

Britain’s first 140mph train to redefine that Monday feeling
At 5.13 on Monday morning a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 140mph as it streaks from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter service out of London.

That is seen as the crucial tipping point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.

The document allows for a 4% increase in salaries for the lowest ones (in local and regional road transport), and a 2.9% increase for higher ones (international transport).
Hourly rates, for those on lower pay, "go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
There may, however, always be a few difficult ones, who remain uncooperative, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, paid tribute to "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones.
It is a common sense agreement, respecting the workers, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised it as "a historic agreement".

The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, standing two metres tall and with a length of 1.50 metres on two strong hind legs, had a longish skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not be anything special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with such physical features, reports Sterling Nesbitt and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin in Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years in what is today New Mexico, which was back then in a dry zone of the super continent Pangaea at the equator.
The animal lived about 215 million years in what is today New Mexico, which was back then in a dry zone of the super continent Pangaea at the equator.
It reveals a great deal about the relationships, the spread, and the features of early dinosaurs.
"On some days we found dozen dinosaur bones, that is exemplary for sediments from the Triassic period," reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five creatures.
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
Other dinosaur researchers do not quite share this enthusiasm.
"This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories on the early history of dinosaurs." says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for instance.
"This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories on the early history of dinosaurs." says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for instance.
According to current doctrine, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, for which reason the classification of these primal dinosaurs is highly contentious.
As such, the experts debated, for instance, when the saurians split into the three most important lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and birds, the four-legged sauropods known as the "long necks" and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischiae (bird-hipped saurians), which included, for instance, the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.

According the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primal theropod.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.

Tawa Hallae's bones of the spine were obviously also partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
As the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the joint ancestor of these two groups will probably have come up with this useful innovation.

This theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more theropods which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of Tawa Hallae.

An older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in what is today Poland, says the Bonn-based palaeontologist Martin Sander.
How dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sidearm of the reptile tree to become the ruling tetrapod vertebrate of the Mesozoic, is still anybody's guess.

During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with a large amount of other reptiles, for instance with the ancestors of today's crocodile and pterosaurs and with numerous other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic period, the dinosaurs spread across the globe and developed many new species, while their relatives died out on the threshold from the Triassic to the Jurassic periods.

In any event, the success story did not last for ever.

The vacation by the police of the Casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is having repercussions throughout the world.
278 professors and teaching assistants of the Goethe University, but also of colleges from all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are showing their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in both German and English, they "condemn" the police action initiated by the executive committee.
University president Werner Müller-Estler had the building seized by students and assistant professors on strike last week, because walls and objects of art had been besmirched.
The material damage, the signatories argue, does not justify "the forceful dissolution of self-organised courses of students and lecturers by a police commando unit".
The vacation represents "an inacceptable infringement" on the freedom of research and teaching.

Zelenograd, one of ten districts in the capital Moscow, was a highly guarded location for secret arms research during the Soviet Union.
Nowadays, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is regarded as Russia's Silicon Valley.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The Moscow Deputy Mayor, Yuri Roslyak, and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd led the Russian delegation and Economic Affairs Head Edwin Schwarz signed on behalf of Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and small- and medium-sized companies focusing on research in natural science will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Companies of the FIZ will have the option to get a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Zelenograd is the headquarters to the most important Russian research institutes and companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.

Clearly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read out a statement, in which he admitted before Romano-German writer colleagues, i.e. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service, Securitate.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.

Germany was a cosy habitat for the Security spies, as Herta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file, 914 pages.

VfB Stuttgart is still not out of the woods, warns sports director Horst Heldt
Like Gross, players and managers were eager not to overestimate the win over the depleted and hopelessly overburdened defence of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before the horribly awakening three days later in Leverkusen in the 0:4, warned Khedira.
We are not out of the woods yet.
There are decisions which other people take and not Jens, was Heldt's response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the directors of a lack of leadership, who had decided to replace the manager under pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann's statements were "guided by pure egoism", replied Heldt and announced consequences for the keeper.
But, after all, they agreed with everybody else that without the work done by the replaced team of coaches, the strong performance, both in terms of play and spirit, would not have been possible.

For Klitchko this was his third successful defence of his title since his comeback in October 2008.
Before, the Ukrainian had already twice been world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knock-out, which everybody had expected, did not materialise.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02-metre tall Klitchko aimed to dictate the match predominantly with his left hitting hand.

Frontal attack from the opposition: Green party head Jürgen Trittin calls defence minister Guttenberg a liar for providing false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left Party demanding a clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent revelations regarding the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has accused defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate deception.
The minister apparently made "knowingly false statements" regarding the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in September, said Green party head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme Tagesschau.

But anybody experiencing dream-like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake, is regarded in contemporary Western society as a madman or drug addict, or strange at the very least.
Even if their triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shaman detachment from reality conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.

Hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional.

Aristotle understood hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, detected in 1861 a "huge similarity of madness and dreamlike conditions", for Sigmund Freud dreams were even "a psychosis, with all puzzles, delusions and misperceptions of such".

Environmental impacts also play a part - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychoses if the disposition is given.
Hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychoses, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get the same, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten.
The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get the same, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether these illusions are perceived to be pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions; last year he assessed his results in a book titled The unreal World in our Head.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under certain conditions.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she is living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school.
During breaks, it can happen that a lanky boy with long dark hair approaches her.
They think the girls is a nutty daydreamer, but Sarah K. is not dreaming, she knows that much.
She is awake, she sees and hears this boy, just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her.

When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes.

She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boyfriend.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows exactly that she is not mad.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment.
Her hallucinations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father.
Hallucinations are also images, which the brain creates, this is why they seem so real."
Illusions at night are also classified by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Contrary to schizophrene patients, mentally healthy people are able to identify illusions as unreal.
In our far too conscious-centred world, imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience, a particular form of conscious conditions which are warped like dreams.
The oneiroid condition occurs in trauma- or sickness-related extreme situations, for instance in polyradiculitis patients, who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self- or world loss, for instance due to persistent, complete loss of mobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with an own, imaginary world, which is uncoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.

Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole's attempt to safe itself.

He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
He is abducted by a Greek man on his motorbike to his homeland, surfs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the mafia.
He is fully taken up with the imaginary events; everything is real, even later in his memory.

Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated twisting of the European Commission's arm to get affordable roaming rates across Europe has had almost no noticeable effect.
There's a fear of using data outside one's home country, and rightly so.
For a gadget like the FonPeek (it no longer seems strange that it is called Fon since it lacks WiFi) to get this kind of fee, it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of recouping the cost of their data networks.
The Kindle is another good example, including a book downloading feature and other internet queries.

"You must not feel the springs when touching the mattress with hands or sitting down on the mattress," warns Helena Prokopova.
It is hard to air the mattresses; you can not wash the fabric either, which should be a must today.
And since we normally perspire 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat during the night, it is obvious that after five to seven years the mattress will resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
Therefore, the practical advice from vendors is as follows: Do not give up hygiene for mattresses with a width of 120 and 140 cm and their removable and washable cover, rather add a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are now commonly manufactured with a zip around the perimeter, so after opening you get two parts (vital for washing and the size of washing machine!), handling the larger types when removing them (and in one person) may remind of a match of light-weight fightnig a heavy one in the ring.

For non-positioning slats with 14-18 blades, latex or sandwich mattresses will be suitable (maybe a combination of latex and coconut), but it always pays back to get the slatted bases with larger number of blades, 28 or more, where there are double blades in the lumbar area and their stiffness can be regulated.

Mattresses with spring frames should not lie on adjustable slats as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of slats you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.

Even mattress manufacturers respect it when in "men" mattresses they began to use the softening zone right in the shoulder area.
They also remember the women - those indulge in the softer surface of the hip area.

There is simply an organic trend even in mattresses.
"Organic in mattresses means that the core is made of purely natural material," explains Petr Vasicek from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural products are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
While men are "cooled" by herbal extract of birch, so that the mattress cover would absorb heat and cool the body, women are on the contrary "warmed" by the covers.

Devices for people monitoring are required by more and more parents, who want to watch their children
Fear for their own child brings more people to the idea of watching them using GPS.
The system originally created to search for cars could also monitor the movement of people and thus should help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Annie Janatková.
The facility is currently of the size of a matchbox, but it may soon be as big as a watch.
Many people have been scared by the case of missing Annie and thus began to search for ways to protect their children better.

The problem of current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either a device similar to pendants of matchbox size or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk of their loss.
According to Pilin from the Macro Weil Company a device that looks like a conventional digital watch is now being tested.
"Or they recognize it after some time and it may give the police extra time," he adds.

Only thus could be the army annual consumption of sixty kilometers of igniter cords justified.
However, if the basic training of any new professional actually needed just two meters of the igniter cord, as the experts say, then the army has ensured by the purchase - even with increased consumption by engineer or special units - the stock for the above 225 years.

The whistle blowing website, Wikileaks, is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called upon other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
A short while previously, the internet company Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches in order to be able to cope with the high number of people accessing the documents.
If Amazon had issues with freedom of speech, "it should give up selling books."
Amazon stopped Wikileaks using its servers after colleagues of Senator Joe Lieberman started to investigate, reported the broadcaster CNN, quoting Lieberman's office.

Maestro gelatiere Luciano Ferrari begins the course by describing the ideal characteristics of a perfect ice cream.
Not only a good flavour, but silky softness and good texture are key.
Not only a good flavour, but silky softness and good texture are key.
The first step of production seems very easy.
Then he turns a tap on the machine and out comes a pasteurised, basic white ice cream, the basic for all milk-based ice creams.
The lecturer is immediately overwhelmed by questions. Can you make ice cream using natural ingredients only without stabilisers?
Luciano warns against letting the spirit of the age lead you astray.
Anyone who talks about making ice cream "using natural ingredients only" has probably used stabilisers anyway - in most cases a natural product such as guar gum from guar beans.
Of course, you can make ice cream without stabilisers, but then you have to sell it within a day, as otherwise it collapses and your customer ends up licking lumps of ice.
Some variations to the base are allowed.
For ice cream flavouring, Maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section and in the sweet section of the supermarket.

or with a white ice cream base that can be turned into yellow cream by using eggs or can be mixed with cocoa powder to form the base of all kinds of seductive chocolate.
Luciano lets each of them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base and with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural ingredients.
The experiment is repeated with the range of fruit sorbets.
The team that produces the most popular kiwi ice cream uses more fruit, less water and a little less of the stabiliser.
The taste of a gelato only really stands out if the mixture is balanced, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a matter of arithmetic. If sugary peach purée is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe has to be reduced.
Luciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the types of fruit (vintners use it to measure the density of grape must using the Oechsle scale).
Fortunately, tables make the calculations easier.
It is not just the machine, which produces the base.

"It would be a crime if they were ground into gravel or disappeared into landfill," he says in his office, a small wooden shack that was once a sentry box.
People insulted and threatened him, he recalls, when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
He explained that there was nothing he could do about the demolition.
And if it were going to happen, then the most sensible thing was that the stones were used again for other purposes.
Some as a keepsake, but others in the hope of being able to return the blocks if the building is rebuilt.

There will be no new drilling off the coast of the US Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming year.
The government in Washington has published a prohibition to that effect - thereby definitively scrapping earlier plans.
New drilling is also forbidden off the Atlantic coast for the immediate future.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April was the trigger for the strict prohibition, which is to remain in force for at least the next five years.

It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies, as the safety situation in the shaft where the accident happened remains precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
A probe was lowered into the shaft, but no signs of the survivors were discovered.
Owing to the high concentration of poisonous gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescuers were allowed into the shaft for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts acted on the assumption that there was no chance any of the miners had survived.

The film director Nicolas Winding Refn is testing old genre boundaries afresh with his warrior epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience was the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn thinking of when he was shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) escapes his tormentors and knocks down his opponents with almost superhuman powers - which sounds ideal for young male viewers on the search for gore and action, particularly as our hero has a preference for brutal killing methods and is not averse to tearing out the entrails from the living bodies of his enemies when he is in a bad mood.

On the other hand, One-Eye, as he is actually called, does not say a word during the entire film, and even the other figures are only induced to say one or two sentences at most, or to emit a few excruciating death cries.
Otherwise, the film is silent, luxuriating in the eerily beautiful hills of Scotland that provides the scenery for the Viking world of around a thousand years ago.

Since his wild and stylised drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," Director Winding Refn has been seen as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream by using a little more humour or to the art house by displaying less brutality.
Most art cinema enthusiasts would be deterred by the cerebral matter and entrails flying around.
If they have not already done so, action fans will die of boredom when One-Eye - for somewhat indecipherable reasons - sets off by ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries, ending up stuck for what seems like an eternity in dead calms and fog before the crew arrives in what is clearly America - where the silence continues.
This is a shame, particularly because the cinematography is superb, but also because at times there is a stirring work of cinema behind the pretentious, at times bloody façade - and that work of cinema deserves some attention.
For the viewer, there is no escape from that dream.
Refn hardly allows the viewer a single moment of relaxation and slowly chokes the same view with his iron images and the gloomy trance-like soundtrack - and the incomprehensible hatred that strikes out at the viewer from the hearts of the characters.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country is refusing to comment - but is allowing inspections.
The name turns up in IAEA documents when there is mention of the reactor Syria is alleged to have built in the cube-shaped building hidden in a valley cut off from the country's electricity network - with aid from North Korea.

Nonetheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by chief inspector Olli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in El Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA obtained commercially produced satellite images from a Member State from the period immediately preceding the attack - images said to be more convincing that the images presented by the CIA.

So the investigation has continued since June 2008 without conclusion and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," according to a high-ranking western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - ultimately, a serious infringement of the non-proliferation treaty remains unresolved in the hands of the IAEA.

The IAEA clearly believes the key to moving forward in this process lies in three additional facilities that are supposed to have had a "functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and in contrast to the reactor, still exist.

It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - it is precisely for this reason that Syria is refusing the IAEA access to the three locations.
This fear was exacerbated by the fact that nuclear inspectors had been tipped off about the facilities by the US secret services.
The IAEA has documents, including satellite photos, which suggest that material has been transported between the three locations and the cube-shaped building on the Euphrates river.
A high-ranking western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production."
This type of reactor is fuelled by uranium, but not enriched uranium.
However, a reasonable guess could be made as to where the uranium came from and where the plutonium from that uranium would be extracted for use in a bomb.

The salt mine of Al Tibni, located just several kilometres from El Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates and investigated by Syria in 1998 as a possible storage location for radioactive waste is an unlikely location, according to the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently connected the mine and the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine, Jane's Intelligence Review.

Although western diplomats in Vienna had offered reassurance, by saying that since the reactor was destroyed the issue had low priority, the US ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections to the table, which is one of the most powerful instruments available to the Vienna-based atomic authority to carry out inspections.

Love in times of war

She wrote the script herself - a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.

The meeting must take place in Bosnia, insists Hasečić.
According to Hasečić, there were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's behaviour towards victims told her enough about the script.
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read her script issued a permit for shooting in Sarajevo after some to-ing and fro-ing - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then did not go to Bosnia.

The fact that Jolie's film actually begins before the war is clear.
According to Jolie, the pressure on her is "unfair and based on false information."

What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
Mr Ma passed the test, but only just.
The election saw most of the staples of Taiwanese elections, including rowdy campaign trucks and flag-waving mass rallies with skimpily clad dancing girls.
It even saw the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.

Arsenic-tolerant microbe raises possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients widens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients widens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
While researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"That makes it very peculiar, though it falls short of being some form of truly 'alien' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.

But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, Calif., is able to continue to grow after substituting arsenic for phosphorous.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.

It didn't.
The discovery "does show that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.

The microbe does grow better on phosphorous, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.

Arsenic was more common in the early times on Earth, she said, so researchers have speculated that early life forms might have used it.
"It does suggest that that there could be other ways to form life, not just how life formed on early Earth," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.

Moelis' and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial woes and satisfy the studio's 140-plus creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed in late 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the $2 billion-plus that creditors were seeking.
By the spring of this year, it was back to the drawing board as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally endorsed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's firms will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5-million payment.
Cooper's firms, which have been collecting $375,000 per month for their services running the company, will receive a $4-million "success fee."

Interviews, e-mail and other documents first disclosed in October 2009 in The New York Times indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, secure lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Because Mr. Hampton had recently been an aide to Mr. Ensign, he was barred by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called revolving door lobbying ban.

The claim could force appeals judges to grapple with the question of whether new technology requires new courtroom rules.
"As I experienced it during this trial, I think there's a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting an individual's fair-trial rights," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes's chief defense lawyer.

In a landmark 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the news media.

The defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudiced when Judge Blue declined to allow them to test potential jurors' reactions by showing them grisly crime-scene photographs during jury selection.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a juror who had been critical of prosecutors and that he improperly added pressure for a verdict by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliberate over a weekend.

That's hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of testing - probing one another for signs of cooperativeness and compromise while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for renewed partisan warfare.

Which is why the meeting on Tuesday and the participants' reviews of it afterward were done with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deeply held to suggest any quick change in the climate that existed during the past two years.
Still, the November election has tempered Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no question that tonally things have changed," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now with the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and nobody favors that.
Similarly, compromise is likely on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans can't afford to look like they favor tax cuts for the wealthy while denying jobless workers unemployment compensation.

But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the lame-duck session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"I view most of what happens between now and 2012 as an undercard, or shadow boxing, to the main event in 2012," he said.

That, however, may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there appears to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans then.
Given that reality, the civility on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans.

As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla war from their bases in western Cambodia's mountains and jungles, Ta Mok cultivated a following in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a U.N.-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
With their benefactors no longer providing for them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have descended into the grinding poverty common in rural Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic for the movement.

"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin trying Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.

The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington published yesterday, give more spicy details to get one's teeth into.
A cable dated 22 Setember 2008, in the very middle of the federal election campaign, tells to what extent the United States form part of the stakes being debated by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex is perhaps inducing Canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal stakes, rather than blame this election on the United States (as during the free exchange campaign of 1988).

"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex is perhaps inducing Canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal stakes, rather than blame this election on the United States (as during the free exchange campaign of 1988).
The United States therefore are, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, since the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
The other expression of this important sentiment is found in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.

A worldwide plan for renewing lighting.
Yesterday at Cancun UNO put forward a plan of renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to securing a reduction of greenhouse gases (GES) corresponding to almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilise the planet's climate by 2020.

According to the plan tabled yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still hold 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs, or better still, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or LED in English), the bulk of the 1.8 thousand million tonnes of GES emitted on the planet to provide illumination for human beings, would be avoided.

The WikiLeaks affair has a double significance.

The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what it was possible to read for months in any daily (except in those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinister caricature profile of Khadafi has long been a cabaret artists'sketch material.

And this is so not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do previously unpublished research (and does not know where to look for news about what does not exist), but because those who devote themsslves to occultism, do not believe what they already know and which confirms what they had already learned.

Now that the European Commission has proposed a harmonisation, certain member-States including France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses what suits him/it best.
The European Commission, for example, took for its reference the year 2009; international finance is maintained and it is adding 150 milions over 3 years as fast start finance. les financements internationaux sont maintenus, et elle y ajoute 150 millions sur trois ans au titre des financements fast start.

Another crucial element, the separation of gifts and loans.
Clearly, this is difficult to justify; the effort is not coparable. l'effort n'est pas comparable.
But France need only reason that it "observes" it commitment of 420 million Euros making 91.5% of loans (399.8 million Euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million Euros) - see European Union document for your own verifcation. elle "respecte" son engagement de 420 millions d'euros en faisant 91,5% de prêts (389,8 millions d'euros) et 8,5% de dons (36,1 millions d'euros) - voir le document de l'UE pour vérifier par vous-même.
It is the only country of the Union to use loans on such a massive scale.
In other words, when the great majority of the European Union gives 1 Euro to meet its commitment, France only gives 10 centimes and regards its effort as comparable.

Nearly no excitement in the first half, and a great portion of luck in the other.

Damjanovic and Vucinic became the match's least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities.
Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination; the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time.
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half. Long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the Czech defence.

An Obese Child's Diet: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Again, we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development.

For example, sausages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight.
Over 19% of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called Obesity is No Accident.

"For example, only half of those inquired said they have five meals a day, in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner pattern, one of the basic preconditions of correct diet," one of the results of the research says.

Though over 40% of children do sports regularly, the number drops down to less than a half - 15% - when it comes to their parents.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions.
"Especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks," the final report of the survey concludes.
As the main dish for lunch, pasta won very tightly over poultry.
However, children showed very little interest in legumes, fish, and vegetable lunches.
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits provided they are given correct information.
"Many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the end of the Obesity is No Accident educational lecture," project results show.

This was quite significant, for example, in case of sweet soft drinks, where more children would begin to prefer plain water.
In addition, for their main course, children ticked poultry and fish more often, limiting sweet meals and dumplings.
In the opening article on stylist training, I was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons.
Lectures by three experts from the field; dressing tips for difficult figures; and a seminar on how it works in practise.

Given the abundance of such information and figure types, I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head.
Still, I fear it is too much, with regard to the homework we were given.
We must consider their current appearance, their fashion style, and figure type.

I am to dress Miranda Kerr whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
Inside I rejoice, as she is so much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a ton (please, understand I am exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.

In this case, variability is key.
For example, a trench coat may be worn in the standard way, over jeans and T-shirt, as a coat; but it may also be worn on naked body, with step-ins, as a dress.

From Ben, the photographer, I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of.
Now I also know that in the picture, a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality.

Just look at Madonna, who is no miraculous singer, yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star.
Even famous people often consider it redundant (believing it is sufficient to be good at something, and how they look at it comes second).
Then, we are left to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining/losing weight, etc.

That is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need.
Aside from the obvious things, such as scissors, a sticky roller, or safety pins, it should have a nylon thread (for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clip-ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large (pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes), or a sewing set.

I am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake, no matter what people say.
V Need for Speed: The Run takes place across America.
An originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes.

We were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs.

The game represents a possibly decent arcade race, but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years.

It actually turns out to be good for the game, because this feature does not get to be boring; within what was already said, it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining.
The driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts.
Still, this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing, even though we could find better at the competition.

In contrast with the driving model, the collision model is not that good.
From a game of this type, one does not expect complicated deformations and collisions, but when you have no idea, before crashing into any object, how your car will act, something is not right.
Or, crashed completely.
The restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track, the game takes you back to the last interrupted point.

At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration, no matter if you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or one minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily, while when you get there, the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down.
While playing the game, you find several places, where, regardless of time, the same competitor overtakes you at the very same spot.

Yet another setback difficult to understand; is the situation from the last race in the story.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (let's say you do), where you speed down the tracks in the darkness (let's say you do).
Your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say it does), when suddenly, a subway train comes running down from behind you, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.

Czechs have the reputation of being negative and euro-sceptical

The ambassadress reminded the key slogans she took to Brussels: "About Europe, Clearly."
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels, people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers, different size bananas, or that someone wants to ban our cheese specialties.'
She also wants to use the EU environment better, and get more Czechs into European institutions.
The ambassadress says Czechs are said to be Euro-sceptics; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions.
She thinks numerous factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; together with low support from the Czech side.

Development of Trip Prices Since 1989
As travelling to the West was strictly limited, travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries.
For their holiday, Czech tourists thus went to the sea to the German Democratic Republic; Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea near the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both to the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, the Yugoslavian regime turned West, which caused significant limitations to trips to Yugoslavia for Czech tourists.
A great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovaks too) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries.
At the time, travel agencies would offer some trips to the West, but one either had to stand in a line overnight, with a sleeping bag or have some "good friends" in the agency.

Still, that was not all.
Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible; without the currency assurance, it was not possible to obtain financial means (Western currency) for travelling West.

Czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tours slept in parks in tents, because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible Czech Crown. After decades, our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies.

Since 1997, increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts.
By the end of 1990s, Czechs did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries, except for the USA. This made our travelling even easier.

General Meeting Should Find a President, Mate Threat Returns

If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the Head of Pilsen football players, Tomáš Paclík, saw a strong candidate, who would meet all of his expectations of a new Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) President, he would not even apply for the top function.

"But no such person has currently been found," Paclík said to ČTK.
Paclík's motivation to join the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to try to prevent Pelta, reportedly the favourite of the elections, from entering the top of the FAČR.

"I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point, they don't even want to identify themselves with Czech football."
At the moment, Paclík's strongest disagreement with Pelta is based on the latter's connection to Roman Berbr, President of Pilsen's regional football association. Berber is a man of controversial reputation, who is, behind the scenes, known as powerful lobbyist, capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates.

Paclík therefore finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become the President.

"Combined with support from Berbr, a capable businessman, this would be even more harmful for the football," Paclík said.

"And how would we look in the eyes UEFA and FIFA," Paclík said. He is now more detached from his former statement saying he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became President."
In case Paclík wins on Thursday, he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fiasco.
"I don't poke my nose in what I don't understand either,' said Paclík, who gained a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of board of referees, led by Luděk Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.

"To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, leading to disgusting situations," Paclík said. He does not hide his antipathy for, e.g. Sparta's Director, Daniel Křetínský.

"That's one of the key things the new President should attend to."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly say where the money will go," he said.
Paclík does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden, though he claims that an FAČR President should be a non-party one.

Splashing in the diving pool and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stimulated, according to Meder.
The illustrated pocketbook The Joys of Bathing provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of historic pleasure and health oases over 190 pages - and makes you want to leap into the water.

For German citizens the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of those questioned demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities, as trading deepens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a survey conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.

Austria's pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, is a famous textbook example of modern post-war architecture with its clear shapes, glass halls, bold strokes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress.

The original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old red-brown colour of rust-proofing.
And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be.
All this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find a material that was good, cheap and met with the approval of the monument authority," says Krischanitz, pointing to the rough flooring in the basement.
The building has remained flexible and light despite the constraints, problems and conversions.
Krischanitz stated recently that the pavilion "from Brussels" had been tough - a typical "drop in the city" story.
Deutsche Bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter.

There is also some delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently for many years, after an ICE train's axle broke in Cologne's main station.

A UBS trader in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion Euros.

UBS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years.
It began in the financial crisis.
As a result, in 2007 UBS was managing 1.6 billion, thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
and had risen to the league of the world's biggest banks as an investment bank.

In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly stepped down.
The investment division of the bank had gambled on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions.

The bank actually managed to find investors, but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined a short while earlier - a less than transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive, even its name was not disclosed.
That was just the first blow.
The bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel - the second best paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.

The second catastrophe followed closely on the heels of the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with the USA and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank.
UBS therefore more or less admitted having been an accessory to tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fog of secrecy.

The CEO and the Chairman then resigned and

The bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion.

It was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made Swiss bankers the guardians of the world's major assets - no excessive risk, but security for money, whether the world fell apart outside the Alpine republic or not.

The location alone is classic.
The bank has its head office on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake, surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Jewellers such as Tiffany's are to be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.

A heavy revolving door opens onto the UBS reception.
The walls within are clad in marble behind vast leather armchairs. There is a large sign to the "Safe" next to the bank's logo.
UBS knows that its clients are looking for - security.
But both the major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point ousted the Swiss banking concept - or betrayed it, as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes.
He would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too, like all Swiss bankers, does business with the two major banks.
It was in fact Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought in its first big profits - and then the debacle. No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank.

A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow.
The fact that the two banks that went to form UBS complemented each other helped. One was a wealthy but sedate bank specialising in asset management in Zurich and the other was less wealthy, but much more internationalised.
Two names are connected with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And Wuffli ultimately may have made a critical error. "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.

Commissioned management consultants, however, pointed out a weakness. In terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as "fixed income," UBS was far behind the very largest banks.
To plug the hole, UBS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in US subprime securities.
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out, UBS carried on.
"UBS was buying as late as the summer of 2007 when the US housing market was in flames," says banking expert Geiger.
The greater the rise, the greater the fall.
The greater the rise, the greater the fall.
Any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job.

The bank, however, is not (yet) prepared to go that far.
It is clear, nonetheless, that investment banking must shrink significantly.

War floods these people's lives like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
"The Beauty and the Sorrow" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German high-seas fleet seaman.

In dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war has "unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."

Military Faces Mounting Pressure to Crack Down on Rape
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for alleged inaction on rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one.
Pfc. Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a fellow soldier.
But the Texas native brushed aside her concern.
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man came up from behind her, throwing her down and raping her, she alleges.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will anxiously await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Va., that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.

Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
By reaching out through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without ever leaving the office.

"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar Norway," he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people.

For someone known to loathe in-depth interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly eager here to expound on his technological philosophies and business strategies.
At four different points during the interview, there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15-second ruminations, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, aiming for precision.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there's something eerily prescient about the Lost Interview, as Jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.

On pranking the Pope:
Jobs recounts the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
The device has been widely written about before, but Jobs" euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is infectious.

He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, placing a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the globe a half dozen times and you would yell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door," Jobs says with a giggle.
Jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and Wozniak nearly pulled of, ringing the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing their very best impression of Henry Kissinger.

Not long after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's Palo Alto research labs, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."

Working on only 30 days of credit, he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
Long before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs presciently foresaw the ways in which so many industry leaders would stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
You have a monopoly of the market share, so the company's not more successful.

Mexico president's sister apparently defeated in Michoacan vote
Luisa Maria Calderon alleges that drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governor's race.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.

The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
But it is staging a comeback, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have only narrowly edged out Calderon, who had led polls before election day.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the governorship, came in third, a bad defeat for the divided and hapless left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote.

Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates quit local races out of fear.
For the PRI, though, however nasty the Michoacan election looks, a win will help the party's momentum.

"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger 23% across-the-board reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequester, war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the base budgets," Panetta warned.

The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid at 120° C, its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius has a nearly solid state, whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature, said the specialist in chemical engineering.

CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of material, out of which the last three involve the asphalt.
If it were modified asphalt it would spread even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt covering, he added, is placed a final layer called rolling covering, which is made ​​of a fine stone material, meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt.

Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle, it must have a better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and provide road friction.
As being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts, the rolling covering also requires proper thickness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration.

A figure which represents very few cases, compared, for example, with the "black" labour figure.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the subject in June, this would represent 9 to 15 thousand million Euros annual tax shortfall, equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infinitely higher than losses due to fraud.

Now, according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised, there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application, that is to say, the practice of euthanasia, or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent, or not consenting.
On the contrary, affirmed during a teleconference, Jocelyn Downie, who submitted the report, more such cases were found precisely in those countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised.

Last week, AIEA announced its serious disquiet concerning a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS drawing largely on AIEA documents, M. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for 30 years from the 'sixties onward, in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture by explosion of synthetic diamonds.

The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.

Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers, in particular unskilled ones, exerting downward pressure on wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to, rather than replacements of, local labour, exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors, which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment.

In the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1% in the migratory flow causes an increase of between 0,6 and 0,9% in real long-term pay.
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
Th World Labour Organisation estimates that for example in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30, will make a net contribution (receipts less expenditure) of an average of 150,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime.

The world according to the republican presidential candidates
Concerning China, Iran, aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge.
For some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations, which are traditionally a republican strong suit.
Mitt Romney, the best placed for nomination of the "Grand Old Party," threatened to drag the Chinese before the OMC and to accuse them of "manipulation of their currency, a sensitive subject in an America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of its industry to Asia.

So much the worse if this should trigger a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy, has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions.
He called for a muscular, but a constructive, dialogue with Peking (the current position of Obama).
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran, if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, declares an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat, because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that China has possessed it since 1964!

For Gazprom, the completion on time of this huge project is a victory.
The project was fiercely competed for by Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any passage via a third country (Poland or the Ukraine).
At the most critical point of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new "German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.

That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies.
But at the price of depriving Europe of energy, since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe.
"This gasduct is a component of partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which links us organically," confirmed François Fillon inaugurating the gasduct, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.

The construction of this gasduct is also a technical exploit.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete, in order to protect it from ships' anchors.
Ir rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 metres.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman of North Stream company.
It was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora.
The pipeline is a long metal serpent, of weight equivalent to that of 242 Eiffel towers, with no breaks throughout its length, no valves and no maintenance stations.

A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it since the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores.
"In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute," states Jens Müller.

The notebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique, the mole skin which means varnished cotton used for covering benches, for example.
Success is there.
One has travelled far from the production of the first years, when only 3000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine is crossing the Italian frontiers and is exporting to 70 countries, from France to the USA.
It is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser, because the notebook attracts equally a businessman, a student and a professional.
Moleskine consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
Its distributes its notebooks to Fnac libraries, small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known.

Why is the rate of unemployment of handicapped workers so high?
Despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005, the rate of unemployment of the handicapped is still twice as high as the average, namely 19%, versus 9% for the population as a whole.

"At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as high."
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread, being 85% for the handicapped versus 38% on an average.
Briefly, all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the nub of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit handicapped workers.

Result - private companies employing over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of employing the 6% of handicapped workers, fixed by a law dating back to 1987.
The latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now on around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of the Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law.
Proof: The number of "taxed" establishments, like the sums paid, have fallen between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million Euros).

What is more, in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.

But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle, and greatly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
But let's suppose that it really is the Higgs, since the chances of being mistaken seem slim, and see what it is.
However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics.

While lurking in the other are the bosons, a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way): mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles" by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related.

Patients at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocating."
But the disease has made me discover my children.
At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding.
This is palliative care, given when there is nothing else that can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there are palliative care beds for 11,700 inhabitants.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.

53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospital.
Lack of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life, be it at home, in hospital or in a care home.

If a migrant does not understand the language, says Sebelev with certainty, he is doomed to come across unconscientious people, who, pretending to help, will force upon him a "ticket" to terrible, cramped barracks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents, slaving away 12-14 hours a day.

Naturally, this is not so much their fault, but due to poverty: very few Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford even a basic education.
After reaching adolescence, these kids go to work at the first opportunity.
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
In the meantime, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
The reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles.
Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers, without registration, hence the extortion.
"They ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared with journalists.
On the first day of the law's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake.

Naturally, they were not free for their owners: each of the migrants, who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them.
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates could not just be bought.

Right now, nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out early.
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Walmart and fast food chains, the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them.
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Walmart and fast food chains, the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them.
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low-to-medium incomes.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
Availability and assortment made Walmart one of the biggest American corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees.
Protesters on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.

A typical Walmart employee, receiving 9.5 dollars/hour, cannot afford this.
Scientists from the Berkeley University in California argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars/hour, it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars.

Walmart supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day, and during the period Walmart sold about 5000 products a second.
Representative of the corporation, Dan Fogelman, asserted in an interview with a left-wing site, the Huffington Post, that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees left the workplace, and the protest act was just "another PR trick" of the union that organized it.

Participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald's on 40th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars/hour, i.e. more than double their present wages.

The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald's by Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke out. One of them, Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's claims it sells billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!"
Demonstrators were supported by other prominent NY democrats, like Bill de Blasio, a candidate for NY city mayor, who said: "We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees, so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing, which every New Yorker deserves!."
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry.

We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
But for this, we need to identify both the user and the space around him.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
For example, we had a project to control devices in public places, in which we thought about movements, not wide movements, but small, reserved ones.
Movements were not recorded by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles.
It's big right now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch.
In general, the future lies in the mixed control, e.g. movement + voice.
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment?

Potentially, a large number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse, by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect, play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three-dimensional determination of the position.

I am a man of yesterday's culture. I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting.
This is the culture I'm for.
There is such a thing: an official for culture.
Here in St. Petersburg, there are people who could be experts, but they are pushed to the side, because more advanced experts are needed, who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them.

However, with time, it will become reality, when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their offspring, who were born in space.
NKU Head: Svarc System audit has failed because of politicians.
This was said by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office (NKU) in an interview for Aktualne.cz.
"The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, commenting on the current situation.

This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided.
However, just because we have reduced the order limits, does not mean something will be procured.
The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork, and those, who wish to look for loopholes in it, will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher.

How does the audit system work in Germany?
Is there an office like the NKU, or is it organised differently?
Powers are also similar to a degree, though of course Germany is organised federally, so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own.
Public funds, which, for us, are administered by regional and municipal authorities, are audited by the federal courts of auditors there.
When it comes to their legislation, is it more straightforward than ours?
Coming back to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office, is its impact being felt already?

The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet.
As yet, we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure risk detection" system, with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen, because of the changed limits, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes, and so on.

I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "too constrained" and will not be enforceable.
Under the previous rules, parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline.

Is it worth constraining the law in this way, in that case?
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not penalise those, who make a mistake on a technicality, which does not affect the final decision.

Are you planning any more "bombastic events" in the future?
It is not as scary as it might seem at first.
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected.

With time, as our moderator Ladya Angelovic says, it has grown a little out of our control (laugh).
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years, or am I mistaken?
We realised that work, which goes on unseen can be like it never existed.
From the outset, I felt there was potential to do things a little differently.
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something, it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole.

Later, the improved RM-1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds.

Of course, in 1962 further research was stopped.
The successor to the RM rocket type was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C), which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus.
Three models were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C), which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a space of 0.4 litres was available, Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three models was 37km.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg, and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km.

Due to significant labour cost differences (salaries) there is pressure on prices.
On this basis, it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods, "the rug is pulled" from under the competition's prices to capture a greater market share and, in this way, increase its own profits.

The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations, where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition, aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment.

On one hand, this economic system of force, in case of long-term unemployment, on the other, restricted employee rights in the workplace.
This yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich.
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-out centres for the poor, who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage.

At this point we have to ask where this may come from?
If it is to come from other EU states, then poverty is being shifted from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages.

They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stake, they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained, but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government).

In addition, the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.

I believe that they are still finding their way in this role, but they are en route to a "more normal" foreign policy.

I think that in Europe, and even in the USA, a great understanding for the German position prevails.
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya.
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative.
Due to the American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.

Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case.
This is, of course, no simple task for Germany, on account of its relations with Israel.
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role.
If we look at the Euro crisis for example, every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role, various anti-German feelings become apparent.
This is actually the same old problem: one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.

"It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, lawyer within the Taylor Wessing law firm, who specialises in copyright infringement in the Far East.
German companies are also 'legally' copied in this manner, such as manufacturer of sporting apparel, Puma.
Pattloch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office in Peking.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."

The CTMO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment.
In the past year, however, things reportedly "returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow."
Thus the stock of unprocessed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent.
Nonetheless, there are still 81,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office.
This is a record and means that China, for the tenth time in succession, is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications, informed the authority.

The internal costs can barely be calculated, the company archive even had to look through century-old records in order to provide proof.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high six-figure sum in euros" as settlement.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This is a business sector that the group had long vacated, yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration.

Both he and Pattloch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China.
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee.
In actual fact: if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama, they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name, explained Wentzler.

There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world, as according to the estimations of Unaids, the United Nations' programme to battle AIDS.
Meanwhile, more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Gogo Centre.
In this region, no-one can speak the Bantu language fluently, but they can sing it.
For almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign, 'soft' language, and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa.

Initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him/her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year.
However, just one year later, the choir established the "Voices for Africa" Association, which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni at an almost professional level.

The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low; however, around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group.
How has the number of infections developed?
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001, to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007.
Condoms can reduce the risk of contraction, however, they do not offer 100% protection.
Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany, the money all adds up.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, Chairperson of the association.

The Gogos, as the old ladies are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them, providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctually every day, in their school uniforms.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school,built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organisation, PSI, organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV.
This is nothing to be taken for granted, as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country, the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead.
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.

In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-esteem, which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.

The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their sponsor children.
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map, it is more than well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, that's where the light is," say the people there.
And if you make the 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, to visit the stomping singers in their rehearsal room, you'll see that the light is there too.

However, the unrivalled star of the museum is shepherd Shirali Muslimov who is said to have lived to 168 years old.
And given that the longest confirmed lifespan was 122 years of age, Muslimov's claim seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805, here in the region, and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man married three times and had 23 children, and is said to have fathered another daughter at the age of 136.
Due to lacking documentation, however, there is no scientific proof of age, particularly as there are no birth registers.
However, the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding Lerik reach a biblical age with striking regularity.
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this as being due to the special Talysh genetics.
In contrast, Museum Director Fatulayeva believes that it is due to diet.
However the notion that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either.

For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islamists.

Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo, in unfamiliar unity, and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect.
"The revolution is back and we are going to be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place candidate in the presidential elections.
Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belongs "on the rubbish tip of history."

Now you have the nose-numbing smell of rakfisk, one of the great Norwegian delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and that odour, ever present, hangs in the air.
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes devoted to this most, well, captivating of foods.

If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on rather a long bus journey.
Rakfisk is a product of very different, poverty-stricken times in Norway when, pre-refrigeration, fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, emigrating mainly to the US.
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by plentiful jobs, high wages and a comprehensive care system.
People from Sweden, the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway, stream in to work.
Rakfisk is seen as signifying something important, a vital if rather smelly part of Norway's past.
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way.
The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway's present-day wealth.

Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.

"We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for Mr Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
Particularly in terms of security and the economy, we're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs.
After an unbroken 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.

In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo couldn't be sharper.
Tucked away under motorway flyovers, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also gritty and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly acute.
On a patch of wasteland by a vast landfill site, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.

In a concrete home typical of the rundown neighbourhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
There were signs she'd been beaten, and rigor mortis had already set in.
However, that is exactly what the family say they have been denied.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up.
As President Pena Nieto receives the sash on Saturday, it comes with a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, prosecutors contend

The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online by WikiLeaks.
In Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico's brig, where he was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011.
When Fein asked about the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as "excellent" and treatment by the facility overall as "very professional."

The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier.
The military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others.

Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the brig at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.

Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation that he made in Thursday's testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count.
Manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself but hadn't done so.

The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme.

Counts against Manning include aiding the enemy, wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records.

The only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.

Besides, we're aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
Our existence is, as they see it, all about failure.
And we wouldn't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're a part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you're rooted in neither.
Now, to complicate the relationship even further, as I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect with the Diaspora.
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
And, with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a great country.

If at least some Mexicans aren't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that.

Amid the usual futile arguments over who started it, scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.

But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing.

Moreover, Hamas's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends.
Jubilant Hamas people say an Islamist crescent is curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hizbullah party-cum-militia holds sway, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bashar Assad, and on down through Jordan, where Hamas's allies are menacing the king.

Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas's missiles have been destroyed.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.

While Australia has one of the world's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals' profits, other countries are considering similar steps.
Tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade, leading to cheaper, more accessible cigarettes.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, silicon covers to mask the unpalatable packages, had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia's high court.

We have to ask, is that just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and they've gone to the trouble of making a video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing.
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging.

And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days, we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days, we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we embrace boredom?
Not so, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Boredom actually has a very long history," he said.
There's Latin graffiti about boredom on the walls of Pompeii dating from the first century.
Then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it has been defined, and discussed, in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.

After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity."

What separates boredom from apathy, he said, is that the person is not engaged but wants to be.
With apathy, he said, there is no urge to do something.
The core experience of boredom, he said, is "disruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly."

The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests, I don't have time to do everything."
Using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes needing more, and a variety of, external stimulation.

In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by beeper.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the boredom percentages now, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said he did know that "adolescence is a peak period for boredom," largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
Sometimes no, because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it, research shows.
"Boredom is the brain's way to tell you you should be doing something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.

Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
After the vote, he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment.
Right now, 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, though many are facing other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts.

And the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambivalence among local officials about the state's big green experiment.
"It's a cultural barrier" with district attorneys, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don't really accept that this is legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales, they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.

Once at the top, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then, lugging their heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down, 1,850 metres above sea level.
This is PT Ngrimbi Candi, a company which, since 1960, has been exploiting the volcano, and quite literally its workers, whom it pays 662 rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells the sulphur for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.

Singapore is a rich, high technology city State in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, known as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, said that it is a result of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single, and delaying marriage and births, which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.

"I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager and federative president of the National Team during the '90s," recalled Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for over 50 years.

I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me 'I've got a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall.
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the sharpshooter Gausse Raymond, who established residency here and was one of our best shooters.
The Vaqueros' championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but from a distance, because in 1988 he was already becoming a federative bigshot.

There were things I'd have liked to implement, such as regionalising the minor leagues.
For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and a course for leaders, table officials and referees.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.

Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.

Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.

At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.
A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.

According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.

In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.
You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.

But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.

Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.
The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.
The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.
"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.
A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.

Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.
For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.
"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.

For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.

The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a "widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.

On the occasion of the Geisingen town anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.
And the Geisingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014, as it was in 1974 that the incorporations to form the current region were completed.
The town of Geisingen was first officially documented in the year 764, in a deed of donation, which is now in the possession of the St. Gallen Monastery.
The deed was drawn up in Kirchen (Hausen), which at the time was the location of the courthouse.
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same deed.
One reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,250-year anniversary in this way, is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the Community Reform (Gemeindereform).

Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.
He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.

In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.
And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.

"This will change my future with my family," the man said.

Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed
The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed
The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.

Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.

Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.
The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.
His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.
Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.

Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.

One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.
Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.

Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.
O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.

To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.
They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.

There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.
Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.

Whether there are still Sunday collections in Hofheim and Rosengarten is not addressed in the inquiry by the FDP.
The FDP spokesperson for social and youth-related affairs, Fritz Röhrenbeck wants to dig deeper into this.
The Sunday collection is an important postal service, especially in the case of scheduled post.
"The company is radically and unacceptably cutting back on this, despite the price increase for letters in January 2013.
Thomas Bittner, Liberal Party Parliamentary Group and Municipal Association Chairman, is supporting his fellow group members: "What annoys me, is the fact that the collection times have been changed or cancelled on the quiet here".
In so doing, the postal service is miles off the mark when it comes to public accessibility.
It is also the case for the town centre that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a Sunday collection on foot.
In the Town Parliament, Röhrenbeck asked whether the Town Council was planning discussions with the postal service regarding this matter.

"According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gutach on the B33 on a daily basis, of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent," emphasised Arnold.
Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary: "Here safety comes first, it's that simple," said Arnold.
A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions.
According to Arnold, every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts: "Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trunks, we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts".

Clear victories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superiority of the Freudenstadt team in all areas.

Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.

Should the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost, in order to increase traffic safety?
Should the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost, in order to increase traffic safety?
Schiltach will have to contribute up to EUR 220,000 to the project.
The Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - collisions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they will be required to contribute one third of the costs, with the remainder divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government.
Schiltach's town master mason, Roland Grießhaber, explained the peculiarities of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing to the Town Council.

Larger vehicles, for example those that transport long logs, would be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic, without having to block the railway line.
Grießhaber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course widen the adjoining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic.

Mayor Thomas Haas retorted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.

Given that it is likely that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel will have to be reconstructed and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time.

According to the councillors, the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority, as the town of Schiltach would "bear the brunt of the cost" for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck, since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work.

But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.
Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.
"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'
This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.

Beneath Cologne, a sewage channel from Roman times, measuring around 120 metres in length, has been preserved.
The two towers, measuring around 157 metres, extend into the heavens, making it Europe's second tallest church building.
However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two ornate church towers realise that there is much to discover beneath the cathedral.
The meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre, right at the cathedral.
The tour begins in a somewhat unspectacular fashion: "We begin in the underground car park," says Schulze.

In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall.
The majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hurry past the Roman relics and simply drop off their car.
"These are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D," explains Schulze.

Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.

Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.

Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.
Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."

Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.

He wrote a 'Theology of the Computer' and questioned what separates humans from the machine, the creator from the creation.

Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.

Harkam also played "his part" in the escalation between Salzburg Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
Schmidt himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the skirmish with Hütter.

It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.
But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.
A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.

Tribukait said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned biosphere area.
The current measures do not integrate seamlessly into these plans.
A biosphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status, and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days.

However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.

Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.
He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.

The historic, one hundred-year-old boundary wall between the old school-yard and Kirchstrasse is in need of renovation, primarily as a result of water and frost damage, on account of the lack of drainage, and is leaning forwards.
Deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage, however, at present the wall is not in danger of collapse.
The school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008/2009, however, high unplanned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back.
The Regional Memorial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming.

Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.
"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.

The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.
Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.

Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.

And right at the front, on the stand, a single large flag with the text "Stadium Ban Section" blew in the wind.
Only when goalkeeper, Roman Weidenfeller, was the first BVB player to step onto the field, did cheers briefly erupt, as is usually the case.
In the central blocks of the south stand, blocks 12 and 13, nothing moved.
Just five minutes before kick-off, the Capo climbed onto his podium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point, lifted with a large shout, as Dickel asked for a shout from each section of fans as usual.

Immediately before the local district derby against FC Schalke 04, some of the travelling BVB fans fired flares into the crowds of spectators and onto the pitch - and in so doing almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.

Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years.
The choice is a difficult one: Should we search for gravitational waves?

Or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmos?
These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency, ESA.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should greatly advance research.
The budget for "L-Missions" such as this lies at around one billion Euro.

Over the coming days, a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
What are the conditions required for the formation of planets and life?
The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in proverbial darkness.

In order to pursue this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map planets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres, and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system function?
This question should also provide information regarding the preconditions for the origins of life.

What are the basic physical laws of the Universe?
Outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature, as known to us, are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could show physicians the path to a new theory, under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
Alongside the materials familiar to us, from which stars, planets and life forms such as ourselves are composed, there exists dark matter, the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe.

Thus far, researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy.

Electricity to become more expensive in Pfullendorf
As Managing Director of the municipal energy company, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, families of four in Pfullendorf will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EUR 70 to 90 per year.
One major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called EEC Levy from 5.277 to 6.3 Cents per kilowatt hour.

New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
But mice who had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.

The former German soldier who, following two tours in Afghanistan, had worked as a doorman, made a confession within the context of a plea-bargaining procedure.
According to the confession, on five occasions he got to know women via Internet or telephone contacts, who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks.
Appearing before the court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion.
Once a psychiatric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psychiatric condition, and thus on his limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a full confession.

The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere good, but at some point everyone has to go home.
Except: In the stomachs of those in the passenger and back seats, hunger strikes.
Of course, this may be down to the odd cocktail or glass of bubbly!
However, on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry clubbers become evident.
What is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window?!

How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.

Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.

And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.
In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.

Reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right.
"As go unions, so go middle-class jobs," says Ellison, the Minnesota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair.

This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks
Amending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative.

The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out.
Wind gusts were reaching about 50km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
Flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.
That flight's delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.

Because the International Consumer Electronics Fair (IFA) in Berlin, once again showed us how incompetent we are when it comes to questions about technology.
The layman, who once knew, blind, how to operate a washing machine and a CD-Player, is today faced with highfalutin expert talk about an array of gadgets, the purpose of which he doesn't even understand. "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies," are what the press office promise us.

So that your yoghurt can place itself on your shopping list; so that your fire-alarm can tell you - when you're lying on the beach in the Maldives - that there's a fire in your study back home.

Everything is geared to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundary between white and brown goods is becoming blurred," mutters an industry insider. You can connect your washing machine to your headphone; your steam oven can send you a weather report; and your data-goggles can tell you how long your pizza still has to go in the oven - but that's of little use if you're sitting in a traffic jam.

Berlin - According to CDU National Vice-Chairman, Thomas Strobl, the current trial taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court to decide whether to ban the NPD from the political process, should be brought to an end.

The reception centre for refugees in Harburg is full-to-bursting.
The German Internal Affairs Authority has now given the go-ahead for the Red Cross to erect the three tents.
"These one-off actions only stir up more doubts in the minds of the public, and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner," said, for example, Britta Herrmann, Chairwoman of the Green Party in the Harburg district assembly.

Glandorf said he had had a "nice long talk" with the Icelander, who will select his squad on Tuesday for the games against Switzerland.
"I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so, and the double burden of also playing for the national team wouldn`t allow me to do that."
The left-hander feared his career might end in 2012 when he had a heel infection.
Glandorf then brought a legal action against the team doctor; however, this ended in a settlement.

Then, the route, which was advertised in three different categories, headed in the direction of Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld, passing by Havixbeck and Billerbeck, and then back to Horstmar.
Chief organizer, Jos ter Huerne, and deputy mayor, Heinz Lölfing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
The organization went smoothly, with no issues, and there were no nasty incidents", Heinz Lölfing positively concluded with regard to the event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped for, which is presumably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.

Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat.
There was "a lot" of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.

Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.
But what was an "award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."

What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What's So Great About...?
The first was on Shakespeare.
I wasn't really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front.

Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.
Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked.
It gave me the feeling that I could do it.
It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me.
Soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors.
There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained.
"A little voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer.""

I walked off the stage and something in me went, "Oh, thank God".
Learning his lines for Fences was challenging.
Henry still has a comedian's brain, though - throughout, our conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions.
I'm just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.

Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home.
He was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14, after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
The teacher training course was in Bamberg.
In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station; take the train to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school; and then make the return journey home.

In 1951, he took his first state exam, and his second in 1954, after spending three further years as a teaching candidate.
Since Upper Franconia had no free teaching place for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Kollbach.
In 1958, he moved into the new-build teacher accommodation next door to the school, into a three-room service flat.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.
In the school year of 1968/69, these classes were accommodated in Petershausen, in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded, the only school left in the locality was the primary school.

In order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school, the then dean, Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.

However, Petershausen continued to grow, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982 onwards, could move into the present-day building, which has since been extended, after Richter took his retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz, who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work-room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 extensions - although the council guidelines governing school-building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work.

"One has to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84 year-old.
At the cost of the council, Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves, and then let the two antagonists fight it out, even if this did occasionally produce a black-eye.
For the benefit of the school, Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz (CSU).
Following his retirement, Richter, who had no political allegiances, was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996.

Under the logo "Cycling and celebrating along the newly-discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants had met up on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and had listened to a concert there by Van Baker & Band.

Not all children back to school in Ukraine
The day is traditionally a big one for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
While there, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
There is not a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the head teacher of Slaviansk School, attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
The first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, carrying balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.

After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, and the words, "Here we come South Carolina!"

Ailinn Solomons was a wild-haired, quiveringly delicate beauty with a fluttering heart from a northern island village more remote and rugged even than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion whom Kevern took to be her aunt, the latter having been left a property in a wet but paradisal valley called, felicitously, Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes leaked, there were spiders still in the baths, slugs had signed their signatures on all the windows, believing the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown with weeds that resembled giant cabbages.
It was like a children's story cottage, threatening and enchanting at the same time, the garden full of secrets.

Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED was happening - fearing they'd be accused of having stoked the flames, fearing, indeed, that the flames would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants, kept their heads down, and grew depressed with idleness.

The same befuddled men, even more thin-skinned and peevish in the aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or twit them.

A score or so years before the events related above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow, the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood, prepared a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction, if not its cessation, was most to have been expected, given the money and energy expended on uprooting it.

"You have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite," her supervisor said when he had read the whole report.
Again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence.
You are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church; and those things you call "vicious" and "brutish," others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality.
To still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as though it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is to sap the country of its essential life force.
Behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
My concern is that, if we are not forewarned, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, in the first place.

And we were just one month away from our horror then.
Now in Ukraine the war goes on, people are dying every day, and I believe many children were killed and will be killed.
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.

It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets close.
I would say he 50% overcame this horror, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.
Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions.
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.

The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both go for around $300.
No matter what gear you use, a few rules apply for getting the best results.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings.
Even if you have an LCD, it's going to hard to see it underwater, and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process.
Stay near the surface.

With most cancers, it is hard to know the exact cause.
In almost every case, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once dubbed "miraculous," but now known to be mortally dangerous.

The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a voluntary industry ban came into effect.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
Britain, it turns out, is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.
There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet.
The reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that, though asbestos use has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.
And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs.

In fact, he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
"Of four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one left alive."
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis.
It is always fatal.
According to Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have played itself out, some 90,000 people will have died.

Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is far from uncommon.

MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true.
While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given "a clean bill of health," it is now accepted £1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament, upgrading electrics and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Benches at Westminster.

One person who has never been able to pinpoint his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.
"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever.
I didn't think I was going to be able to drive all the way home.
Being a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.
The link in that case was clear.
The link in that case was clear.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell, a probe, equipped with a camera, was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."

But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation.
"It has been known that asbestos is noxious to health since 1898," says Morgan.
That is where company negligence came in.
In fact, pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation.
And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side, which the claimants certainly do not.
The law has created a £350m pot of money, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.
The law has created a £350m pot of money, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.
About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350m represents "a very good job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers" he says, suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened, and mesothelioma sufferers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, then Works and Pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."
"People are suffering so much, and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill's second reading in December last year.

Once again the Chancellor makes herself clear.
Following persistent opposition from the CDU, the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of tolls.
He has spoken with Dobrindt on the topic and about further possibilities for capitalizing more and investing more in infrastructure, such as developing broadband.

More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from firms.
Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies" real estate values, researchers say, which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-1 percent growth.
While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well.

AMAZON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer.

The point is, YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was greeted with a yawn, a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through, considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.

Something is happening on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest (castle garden festival).
The organizers' idea was right.
Despite the heavy downpour of rain on Saturday evening, approximately 1200 music fans went to the open air festival in the castle garden.
Admission had to be stopped on occasion.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem coined the name "Armula" from two Spanish words.
Well, you make your own fun anyway.
Around the supplies stand located in the meadows of the castle garden, people from Salzwedel, but also guests from near and far, made themselves at home.

They followed the first live performance, tapped their feet in time, and enjoyed refreshments. In short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment.
Whilst some people sprawled out on blankets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar, which had been carted in especially, others indulged in a glass of wine in the wine store, and the kids went crazy on the bouncy castle, which was a huge attraction for the little guests.

The more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel had organized.
And then the rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 PM the rain pelted down onto the visitors; and families did a runner in search of somewhere dry.
Despite this, the festival's attractions did not get called off.

"More people than expected came", Rom Sem said, who called the event a "success all round".
As such, nothing is going to stop them from repeating the big party next year.
Even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event, the first balance sheet done on Sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for Sem.

He said that one annoying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily.
Apparently not enough security guards had been booked with the security company.
The consequence: Some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds.

Feedback has been very good.
In a preliminary and cautious estimation, the Salzwedel co-organizer estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound engineering.
The hip hop band from Salzwedel, Blocks 'n' Rox, abandoned their performance somewhat unnerved by these problems.
The engineers could not get a half-decent sound out of it.
The organizer insisted that "they will, however, be there next year".
The premier of the Amula-Open-Airs was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors.
Nevertheless, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be excused as it was their first time, but which have to be avoided next time round.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros, I really expected more", Melanie Meier commented on the event's page.

As an example for the reconstruction of the castle in Wolfratshausen, the deceased Richard Dimbath, the former chairmen of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde (Wolfratshausen castle friends), led the project in the French Guédelon.
Up until a year ago, there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in Wolfratshausen.
Their points of view are now markedly different with regard to how the history of Wolfratshausen castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled.
Whereas the castle friends, and the recently deceased Richard Dimbath right up until the bitter end, had their eyes on reconstructing the castle in the mountain forest, the castle club, with Sjöberg, want to "develop and bring the premises to life" in its original place.

The man from Tölz would, however, "like to continue working with them" on the project.
He acknowledges Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.

But with a high number of participants among the population, as well as some volunteers from all over the world, it will become a tourist magnet.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
Their aim to first of all document the history "is important and good".
With the cost of college textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year for many students, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.
He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen, offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back.
Required texts for his last semester would have cost $430, he says.
The College Board says the average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these costs.
Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder's are increasingly the go-to choices for students.

Renting textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for the semester, often at a significant discount to buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores trade association.

Some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $290 but can be purchased new for $239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com.

The book was selling for $48 new.
If so, old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version.

Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted a Hollywood "meltdown."
In light of the current downturn, some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it.
With summer 2015 set to usher in a slate of potential big box office hits, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic.

There are still several of these giant trees in the region; the example shown is the "Geissruheiche", an oak tree, which stands above the village of Unterweissenbrunn.

A rocky footpath leads up to the somewhat 600 year old oak tree.
The tree is located just below the Bauersberg's stone quarry, one kilometer north of the street to Weisbach.

The natural monument looks energetic; it towers above the other trees in the area, and, being more than eight meters in size, it reminds you of an American giant Sequoia.

Despite intensive research, there are only clues to the origins of the name.
Dr Wolfgang Schneider has, once again, consulted the Bischofsheim Archives, and asked elderly people from Unterweissenbrunn in order to find out what it has to do with the Geissruheiche.

A hiking trail leads from Unterweissenbrunn up to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further trails are signposted, which lead up towards Hochrhön and offer an extensive hike.
A moated castle, which we looked for as part of our next challenge, is, of course, rather hard to find way up high.
The reflection in the moat already provides a good impression of the structure, but we do have some historical buildings in the district, and the building portrait may just be a good example of this.

On the other hand, some others found it much easier to complete the full eleven kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
The Green Politician, wearing all red, from the municipal council - red clothes, red bike - looked to be taking it gently ("Quit some professionals here, so it's all about finishing!") - and then looked almost like a pro himself as he arrived at the end 45 minutes later without pausing for breath.

Florian Zierz from Frankfurt got himself into the saddle at 9 am; he "did" the Feldberg twice, before then wheeling back home.
For the manager of the Oberursel cult kiosk, taking part in cycling events which go over the Feldberg is perfectly natural.

And he must be, since he was riding a "Fixie-Bike" which is a bike without gears...
But it wasn't only cyclists who jaunted to the top - as was evidenced not only by the 20 walkers, who climbed up via the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also by a jogger who pulled behind him a tyre with weights attached to him by a rope.
The 718 participants - which made them the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association 'Cycling on the Grosser Feldberg' gave the starting orders and wished those taking part an enjoyable trip.
Next year, he hopes to have safety barriers on the course for the benefit of those taking part on the Feldberg.

In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.
Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.

There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.

Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.

Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.

The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it dawns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."

Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).

On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.

On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.

Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.

Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.

Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.

Incidentally, for once Munich is not in the lead.
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for a 3:0 victory for FC Bayern at Olypiacos Piraeus - then it got better.
Trainer Pep Guardiola's team won their opening match in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders, thanks to Müller's brace (52nd and 90th minutes +2) and Götze's goal (89th minute), ending in a score of 3:0 (0:0).
"We aren't going to underestimate them," promised Bayern captain Phillipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich player kept his word.
Piraeus had won their six most recent premiere class home games, including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United, Atletico Madrid and Juventus Turin.
But Bayern, undefeated in seven Europa Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
Attacks were too often initiated by bringing left winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got past former Brunswick player Omar Elabdellaoui, into play.
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal.
First when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown hit the Pole's header from the line in the 26th minute.

Before the match there was a riot in the stadium.
At least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium.
Smokers damage not only their lungs but also their teeth, concludes a long-term study in Potsdam.
This emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers.
The main reasons for tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE states.
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non-smokers', declared lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England.

People should be persuaded to become non-smokers, declared study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifespan".
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by toothlessness, according to the DIfE.
Earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long term study substantiates these findings.

The creation of TTIP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world, covering 800 million people.
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system to be fair and just, commented Malström.
Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), which is required particularly by large companies, is said to be one of the main reasons for the stiff opposition to the TTIP in Europe.
There was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State for the Economy, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, referred to the plans as major progress.
The Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers.

Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club (now Luxor) in Cologne.
Beside him stands a flip chart on which the shy-seeming folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, some 40 people, is virtually mesmerised by Stevens's performance.
Referring to different places, which each time he marks on the map, he talks about the stories behind his meticulously and subtly contrived songs.
Rumour has it that "Michigan" was the first part of a bold series: it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States.

Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.

Grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.

He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.

Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.
As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.

A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).

Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.

Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'
Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.

Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.

With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.

The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.

The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.
Only Compton got the chance home and away.
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.

He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.
People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.
Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.

While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.

In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection.
My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).

So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.

But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.

It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.

Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.

If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.
The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.

Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.

Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.

Property entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the Middle Franconian town of Eckental for people who do not have much money.
"I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays," says the 44-year-old in an interview.

Mr Gildner, thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market.
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers and gyms is not sustainable.
We will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influx of refugees over the next decades.
A totally standard three-storey terraced house is the solution.
It facilitates integration.
Each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers.
Gildner: The price for 160 m² of living space per house amounts to €184,000 without land.
Construction took six months.

This is also something that happens in the Palatine town of Kallstadt, from where the property billionaire's grandparents originate.
The New Yorker with the blow-dry hairstyle is a concept to many in the winemaking village on the wine route.
Many in the village of 1,200 inhabitants are related to him.
Simone Wendel, a resident of Kallstadt, has made a film about Trump.
And what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world?
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous offshoots, included in whom besides Trump are also the Heinz ketchup family.

Trump, who is not known for his modesty, also gets a chance to speak in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway, even had he lived in Kallstadt.
There is indeed a certain respect for his family's achievements, but there also tends to be a view that Trump "is a bit of a bigmouth," says Wendel.

Trump comes from the village of the braggarts.
The story of the Trumps' success began in 1885 when the man who would become Donald Trump's grandfather emigrated and opened a saloon for gold prospectors in the USA.
The foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York.
But his grandparents' lives were not free of tragedy: their wish to return permanently to their home country collapsed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatine then belonged.

Trump is the grandson of "illegal emigrants".
This is at odds with the sometimes pithy statements of his descendant.

The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
And the three girls left standing certainly aren't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.

"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.

I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.
For her part, Mackay said last week's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.

Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.

Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.

The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.
"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.

They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.

In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.

The chassis makes the difference: every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IAA
Compact class cars are currently very much in demand: according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport (KBA) about 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone belonged to this segment.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car sector here is the Opel Astra, which hits the car dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel boss Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
It is at the heart of the brand.
To ensure that it sells well, the price of the new Astra is not increasing significantly.
Opel proposes an entry point below that of its main competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at €17,650.
In spring the estate car, already seen at the IAA, will follow as the second option
Renault Mégane: Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competitor to the Astra, the Mégane, into the race.
The Mégane can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-door, in a conventional and a distinctly sporty version.
It will be available in dealerships at the beginning of next year, then also as an estate model.

In principle, prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small.

Afterwards the man, who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released, was transferred to a larger cell.
His liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of unsuitable prison conditions however, failed.
But the constitutional judges set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and resubmitted the case there for renewed assessment.

The prisoner at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Karlsruhe case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Because of this, prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness rises and it has even led to brawls due to the tense situation.

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can handle it"

German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge. "I say again and again: we can handle it, and we will handle it".
The following is a summary of what is coming to Germany.
According to various forecasts between 350,000 (estimation by the Ministry of buildings) and 400,000 (estimation by the Pestel Institute) homes will be needed annually – and in fact for the next five years.
According to various forecasts between 350,000 (estimation by the Ministry of buildings) and 400,000 (estimation by the Pestel Institute) homes will be needed annually – and in fact for the next five years.
Federal building minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) thus wants to double funding from the current €518 million to €1 billion.
In the view of the Pestel Institute this is far too little: 80,000 social dwellings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of €6.4 billion per year.
Academics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work.
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society, and also to the self-esteem of the immigrant says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.

While in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years, this was reduced in November 2014 to three months, as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of domicile.

One big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language.

That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.

Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.

Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.

Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.
Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.

That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.

Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bible.
In the beginning was the word?
For Otmar Alt, who has devised his own personal interpretation of biblical stories in 150 motifs on paper and canvas, in the beginning was the picture.
The 75-year-old conceived his "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms - which are however by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for around three years and for this project he made a subjective choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the "Book of books".
And in particular author Klaus Altepost, who has grappled with the particular Bible passages based on the paintings.

The decorated cover of the book is lettered in gold.
The 75-year-old allows at the same time a twofold insight, deep into both his soul and his emotions.
Ultimately, his emotions were the key trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, who was born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhut order.
"Education there took place under the shadow of the cane", remembers Otmar Alt.

His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age: "The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising, which is loud.
Otmar Alt wants his viewers to let themselves "fall into" the pictures, to let them leave their impression, to discover and experience the power they have: "The picture is looking for its counterpart".
At the launch of the Otmar Alt Bible on Tuesday, Klaus Altepost confessed to having "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he sees life with his pictures".
Alt was not interested in recording the whole of the Bible, selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysterious.
Otmar Alt's pictures speak, for Möhler, the (biblical) language of love as well as that of responsibility.

The EU commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neurotoxin.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available, is heavily critical of the plans.
