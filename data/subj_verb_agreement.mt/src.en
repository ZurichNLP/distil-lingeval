Transactions with stocks from the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) reached nearly half of the regular daily trading.
Stocks on the market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but ultimately lowered their losses to 4.3 percent.
"The timing of the bailout action in the USA is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world," remarked the head of the Hong Kong Currency Board, Joseph Yam.
On Monday the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, into which up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion Czech crowns) was to be invested.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's appeal for them to support the plan.
American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and the major stock indexes registered their greatest fall in more than 20 years.
The index had dropped even prior to the vote, but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House, the index went into free fall.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
The chair of the Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters this on Sunday.
Sources say that the senate could evidently vote on the plan on Wednesday at the soonest.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
We've resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabilization of markets should look," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
Representatives of the legislators met with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form.

"We're on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be effective on the market.
Namely, by doing this they want to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets, which, given their time zones, are the first ones where the decision by Congress could influence Monday's trading.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount, in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later, the final 350 billion dollars, if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function.

Though the president can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican senator Judd Gregg.
His speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and save our economy".
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program, protection of the taxpayers against losses, closing of relief packages, and timing of the financial plan.
The new law is also meant to constrain the "golden parachutes" for the heads of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee which will oversee the fund.
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant, according to Marek.
The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time," Marek emphasized.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current head, Wilhelm Molterer, is being severely jolted, suffered particularly great losses.
These are the worst results of both large parties in Austrian post-war history, and particularly for the People's Party, who urged the early elections, it is literally a catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party still had a significant lead on SPÖ in the polls.
In the first reactions to the results, there were already speculations about the possible resignation of the party head and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Such a development would certainly simplify the journey toward the increasingly most likely recourse from the election results, that is, the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
Haider, who has already announced that he is prepared to work together with any party and presumes he will return to Vienna to national politics, is evidently banking on this development.
Evidently none of the other parties exceeded the four percent mark and got into the parliament.
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
In spite of this, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner.
There are price and qualitative categories here as well.
The selection is broad.
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than merely play music, but also what most cell phones can't even do by chance.
Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, most of them much less.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge.
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but very few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adaptor.
For the music players, with some exceptions (iPod), you don't need any special software.
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory, similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating systems).
In choosing specific equipment, you should be interested above all in the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of the audio output, and of course also the user-friendly nature of the operation.
Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do.
Better cell phones, at the same time, enable the purchase of music on-line.
If not, you can utilize the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones, but only in a minimum of MP3 players.
The best and most technically well-equipped telephones, with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The minimum of functions and similarity in operation to the formerly common cassette recorder or even the record player is apparent.
With the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported.
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Sony Ericsson, whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the most advanced in the field.
The mobile market in Czechia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bureau, who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union.
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle.
But there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lowering of prices, to which even the classic operators had to react.
In February of this year, we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns, among others, U:fon, stands behind Mobilking.
In this way, virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer inexpensive calling and text messages, which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services, though.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group.
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual operators are founded.
"We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Czechia don't look very hopeful.
Rather, on the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into existence.
For a longer period of time now, the GTS Novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the area of corporate clientele.
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Regarding this, Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
No such contract has ever been signed, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," claimed Kristián Chalupa from the external relations department of the OPC in his answer to our question.
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one abuses his/her position on the market, it is more than serious.
But evidently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OPC.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations is surely just the product of coincidence and the tough competitive battle.
"The Office did not find any signs of actions violating the rules of competition, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way.
Of course, an analysis of the relevant markets does exist, conducted by CTO, according to which telecommunications are, from the perspective of competition, the only market.
Of course, an analysis of the relevant markets does exist, conducted by CTO, according to which telecommunications are, from the perspective of competition, the only market.
On such a market, none of the Czech operators then have a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator, it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator.
At the same time, complaints from a series of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) demonstrate that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators.
The representatives of the OPC must know this very well, but their interests are evidently elsewhere.
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.

As a significant client, it then gets special price offers (and other types of offers).
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to potential problems: "The law enables such speculation, nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - versions with male or female solo vocals, a choral version and an instrumental version.
"From the beginning, with both of them and also with the chorus, I tried to make sure that they had clear articulation, so that the text could be understood well, so that they were in harmony," he said.
It gained popularity and the people spontaneously took it as their own.
The first stanza of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem following the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
How the "new" hymn sounds
"At these locations, there is a counter available for travellers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purchase, and will also add the purchased coupon to their card," said the project's speaker, Martin Opatrný.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," Opatrný added.
Travelers who do not use suburban buses, and will not remember when the validity of a coupon ends, can head again for the self-service machines where the coupons are added to the card.
This is implicit in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Research Library.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but rather, as liberators," is what is written in the letter, signed "People who are not indifferent to the fate of Šumava".
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but rather, as liberators," is what is written in the letter, signed "People who are not indifferent to the fate of Šumava".
Since the annexation by Czechoslovakia supposedly only gives the Sudeten Germans hope for - knowing the Czech national character - brutality, disregard, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate of Šumava forever.

"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would award this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and oppugns minorities and which has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Allies," is written in the letter.
Though the text of the letter may sound a bit naïve given the contemporary knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately sketches the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
The famous journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, also confirms this.
That's also one way to characterize the emotive media campaign which the Ministry of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday.
And even the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign attests to this:
The words "you don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his/her own life.
The spots will "haunt" the viewers until 2010.

And that's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes.
Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers' attention to the danger.

Olmert would return nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace
He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Monday.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace if we don't do that," he added.
"Whoever wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs, like what happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and tens injured.
"Whoever will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
But that would also require certain effort from Damascus.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.

According to Mukherjee, it would be best for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to higher authorities.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also said this during the negotiations.
"He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to pursue the matter.
Law doesn't know them, walking in coach bus not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question has arisen as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion.
"If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law, the activities of the steward are in conflict with the Traffic Law," says speaker for the Ministry of Transportation Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, during which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was evidently caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply even when the steward is handing out coffee or newspapers.
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role.
If this is not approved in the bus, the passengers must sit.
Eventually they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat," he conveyed his position.
The law does not know the steward
Like in an airplane, says expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traffic Safety (BESIP), does not see any essential problem in the movement of stewards on the buses.
"However, if the bus were to brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics are valid.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against it from the very beginning.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way," concludes speaker Hanzelka, adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"This island, and with it the ocean floor surrounding it, belongs to Australia.
At the same time, the area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team of employees of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.

"Taken simply, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the ocean floor which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea and its substratum.
The request the given country submits to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf must be supported by scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
The commission has thus far discussed five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
"But the ocean floor is no Klondike", director Mikulka says exaggeratedly, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly delimited and their regime is anchored in contracts."
Part of the ocean floor currently belongs to the Czech Republic.
The area investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The ocean floor there is rugged, it is a sort of underwater model of the Tatra Mountains.
The area is a rich locality for the collection of poly-metal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Pakshi Rajan from India.

According to a news report, the government-funding bank had refinanced long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which, due to the mistrust at the markets, is no longer a possibility.
In the first half-year of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 Euros, with the capital resource quota also slightly declining from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.

The opposite cannot be discounted either, however.

So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates.

Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is triggered in a brain that's aware of its own activity.

Back at Hydarpasha station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this edifice being built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions may now, to a large part, be in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited at the terminal for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I recalled that in those days Turkey had always been called "the sick man of Europe."

A Bangladesh court has rejected a bail plea of former PM Sheikh Hasina, meaning that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
The case is one of several corruption charges pending against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to Bangladesh.
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail petition saying that she doesn't have to get bail as she's already undergoing treatment abroad on parole," her barrister Rafique-ul Huq said.

But it later emerged that the fired attorneys had not been rated any more poorly than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the sackings had been politically-motivated.
Some of the attorneys had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
They can be dismissed at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.

The street does, however, have admirers.

Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), posted part of a Talk of the Town story about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
A few passersby said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that it could use some sprucing up.

Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets may fail to revive the economy.
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before once again jumping back up on the back of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.

Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really began with Zora, which is all anyone here calls Hurston.
Bold as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, then veered into more private areas.
In fact, it was not a portrait everyone appreciated.
"Zora told it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing off-color songs about their beauty.
"People were always glad to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, rocking in his chair on a back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never did stay too long."
Along with much of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.

"Black children were accustomed to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
That lasted, she added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You were not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who rose above prejudice, like she did, with buoyant self-assurance and lines like: "How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning in 1988 for a Hurston festival to show what the county could ruin with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many return for the celebration.
"The five-laning of the highway resurrected, it put in what you'd call warp speed, real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Victory over the highway project has helped change the town's self-image.
Eatonville joined the national historic registry in 1998.
Outsiders who come looking for Eatonville's story, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.

Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and all, no better, no worse and as proud, creative, hard-working, silly and mixed-up as other racial and ethnic groups in America.

Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they commuted, from the likes of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken out money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a building society), credit unions and the type of hometown savings banks whose branches only operate within one state, and who say they treat customers like family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bust.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went into receivership, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was on the hunt for a rescue buyer.

As part of his music scheme for the borough, in the next year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were in our late 20s - we just refused to give the choir up.
The musical versatility produced by such a youth choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for the music which remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
He'd say: "The composer knows what he wants.

Police in Kent were granted the foreign travel ban last Thursday after giving magistrates evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sex abuse.
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad as he is required to under the sex offenders register.
He must give the authorities notice if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give police seven days notice of his planned departure date.

When he was freed Glitter flew to Bangkok where he was due to board a flight to London.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.

The Japanese company has created a robot that, imitating the flight of bees, can avoid accidents.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific Research and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles produced by the company.
But the most important element is constituted by the bee's compound eyes, which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees angle, allowing the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space.
But the most important element is constituted by the bee's compound eyes, which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees angle, allowing the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space.
This mechanism detects obstacles within 2 meters and a radius up to 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board that immediately allows preventing the collision.
"When detects an obstacle, the little robot imitates the bee's movements and change direction immediately by turning the wheels at a right or wider angle to avoid the collision.

And most importantly, it has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
In the wake of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Supply for all other provinces and the two territories.

The treatments being more aggressive, patients often need to refill in red blood cells or platelets.

" A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of the thousandth sample of placental cord blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year.
We should start to propose transplants at the beginning of next year, "says Dr. Décary describing this program for collecting placental cord blood as very popular.

Moreover, "with the climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North", he declared, referring to the Northwest Passage, to be held open throughout the year due to melting ice.

It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice" (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, which allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.

Here, we have before us a government that is the only one among all western countries involved, not to have repatriated its nationals locked in the concentration camp at Guantanamo.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has gone back on his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child soldier.
This same government turns a blind eye to torture: little does it matter to it that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, doubtlessly forever, after so many years of abuses.
One does not yet realise, but we are witnessing right now a creeping erosion of our rights, of our liberties, and our "democracy", this word that Harper continues to brandish and that sounds hollow in his mouth.

Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not of baton thumps.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a "public" debate while at the same time disregarding the views of that very same audience?
In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution-gag (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term ...).
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.

The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the next year's approved budget as "terrible" and said that Premier Jan Fischer's government should seriously rethink its position in office.
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and futility, while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to really threaten to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted, the situation would look completely different.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks.
I haven't thought about it, and I'll concentrate on that when the time comes, defence minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, having been elected by the civil democrats.
We don't look like orphans, we're not little children, was how he reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget.

The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Invictus by Clint Eastwood will hit American cinemas, depicting part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
I think it's good that we can commemorate Mandela and his mission in a film.
The film, based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, entitled Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation, portrays the South African human rights activist during his first presidential election campaign.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to go to Britain, admitted in a recent interview for LN.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, although the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been extinguished.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 switching stations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system, as well as 4339 kilometres of power lines.
They claim that we're more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, as we know the Czech Railways prices that were concluded last week.
I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order, worth around 150 billion crowns.

The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination system.
Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta, has been charged with trying to steal paintings worth $20m (£12m) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr Frazetta Snr, aged 81, is famed for his depiction of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, the Associated Press news agency reported.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying the younger Mr Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
A police affidavit said Mr Frazetta Jnr, 52, claimed he had been instructed by his father to "enter the museum by any means necessary to move all the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Snr denied granting any such permission, the agency said.
Ministers have defended the tax rises and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and unions.
Unions have protested that low-paid workers are being penalised for a recession not of their making and warned of "problems" ahead.
The National Insurance increase - which will raise about £3bn a year - has angered the business community, which says it is a tax on jobs when the focus should be on economic recovery.

According to Treasury estimates, someone earning £30,000 will be £90 a year worse off and someone on £40,000 will be £190 worse off, while someone earning £10,000 a year will be £110 better off.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of extra taxes would fall upon the top 5% of earners.
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "debt crisis", said projected borrowing of £789bn over the next six years was unsustainable.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year not to reduce the deficit, arguing the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation increase in some disability benefits next April - would leave the chancellor open to accusations of electioneering as the money may simply be clawed back the year after.
However, Labour insist the extra help is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Although ministers did not publish spending details for beyond 2011, economists said it was clear the squeeze on public spending would only begin to bite in the medium term.
"The all important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to accountants Deloitte.
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five reported US men on suspicion of extremist links.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the US state of Virginia last month.
"If they are American citizens, we of course are going to be very interested in the charges that they've been detained on and in what sort of circumstances they're being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
"We are working with Pakistan authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who had gone missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but said the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing from their homes in northern Virginia by their families in late November.
Dozens have been given jail terms, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.

AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate—and are integrating—into one of the continent’s most avowedly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s last work, "Why the French Don’t Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and closely argued study of an issue that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.

For him, and the other Marines who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C. to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was about paying tribute to men and women who once stood in their shoes.
In a few months, from where we are getting shipped out, this could be us, said Robinson of the fallen soldiers.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on veterans' gravesites across several sections of Arlington Ceremony.

Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal -- giving away free cellphones -- is in Cuba a crime, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a tough report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, Same Cuba," a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
As a result, they were marooned for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a terrorist haven.
The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who can be trusted.
Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-Qaeda.
Would-be American recruits are treated by al-Qaeda with special scrutiny, analysts said.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst with the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruiting methods.
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate from the negotiators working inside the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters said as many 100,000 people joined in the event, but police estimated the count was closer to 25,000.
The police kept the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center, and said they had arrested 19 people, primarily on the grounds that they had either worn masks or carried pocket knives.

But what remains embedded in the latest numbers from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white students both locally and nationally.
African American progress in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dipping a statistically insignificant one point, from 245 to 244.
African American progress in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dipping a statistically insignificant one point, from 245 to 244.
The picture across a six-year stretch isn't more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP in the District was given, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the gains celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were propelled largely by white students who are already high achievers.
I'm not jumping up and down about a two- or three-point spread, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
A frequent critic of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of the test scores is that the city's middle schools are in desperate need of attention.
But what's scary is we're not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, targeted to students in the upper elementary and middle school grades who didn't master the basics of reading early in their school careers and are significantly behind their peers.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Yet as she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition runs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of awestruck visitors than of enthusiastic prospective students.
The question is where.
Although there is mounting concern about the large number U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educations they need to enter the middle class.

When you're looking at low-income kids whose parents don't have the experience and the skills to help them navigate through the system, any single intervention at any one point in time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latino students.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going on to college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one that submitted a bid lost.
Concerns over security, underscored by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely kept American oil companies from venturing more forcefully in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms, have markedly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they don't respond to shareholders.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq.
Companies pre-selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field.
An apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
They were driving in a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official with Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
Somali was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner who ran the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He took strategic guidance from al-Qaeda's top leadership and translated it into operational blueprints for prospective terrorist attacks.
He may not be a household name to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
The tempo of strikes by CIA-run drones has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a tally by the Long War Journal, a Web site managed by a nonprofit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
The U.N. envoy said that he supports the surge but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a military drawdown beginning in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.

He said that "a package of incentives and disincentives" would be needed "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer enormously" from sanctions.
But since then, Iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
But since then, Iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, Iran's stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think, has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iranians, Gates said.
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.

We have already given all our time and energy for just one child.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average birthrate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect, according to the U.N.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that fertile couples need to have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future."
Couples who violate the policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
The response has been underwhelming, family planning officials say.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want more children.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.

U.N. group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illuminated a path forward.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Forged by a U.N. ad-hoc working group, the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term.
It shows the outlines for a possible deal, in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.

The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation.
The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei said America's top climate negotiator was either lacking "common sense" or being "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it's not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions.

Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best.

Some 131 000 people were called on to take part in this first vote following the Georgia-Russia war in August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another secessionist Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The first provisional results were to be announced during the night between Saturday and Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, among whom the existing president, Sergei Bagapsh, all categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which has condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvarchia, a 54-year-old historian, who confirms having voted for Mister Bagapsh.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, while raising his glass of vodka.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, asserts not being in support of the current Government or the opposition.

The Mexican Embassy presented us with a request for safe passage, but, unfortunately, we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Coup Government Interior Minister, Oscar Raul Matute, had declared on Wednesday on Honduran HRN radio.
The rumours of Mr. Zelaya's departure had, on Wednesday, mobilised the partisans of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian Embassy, where military forces reinforced their position.
Zelaya, who had become closer with the socialist Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on June 28th, the day he had organised a public consultation to prepare for his re-election, going against the views of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.

They could not manage it, because the guy was well-built, recounted Alberto, a server in a nearby bar.
National police officers were the ones who arrested the man, who was not carrying any identification documents.
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls afresh for proceedings to be dropped
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", the words coming straight from the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
The Prosecution, for its part, has re-iterated its argument, already formed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously looked at while Roman Polanski did not present himself in court.

The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assures his son, David, on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles, where he was to be by his father's bedside, who has been in hospital for several days.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent his suffering, and to allow his treatment to be administered", indicated the press service.

In the last few days, you have stepped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to regain the UDF acronym, the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem, as well as the senator, Jean Arthuis, from the centre Alliance.
He is profiting in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the UDF acronym by taking it to benefit his own account.

- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
In this way, by suggesting that "levers" [sic] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff, a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr cradles leaders into a position of mechanistic governance, which is unsuited to the world of today.

Tawa Hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, standing two metres tall and with a length of 1.50 metres on two strong hind legs, had a longish skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with such physical features, reports Sterling Nesbitt and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin in Science magazine of Thursday.
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
"This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories on the early history of dinosaurs." says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for instance.

"This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories on the early history of dinosaurs." says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for instance.
According to current doctrine, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
According the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primal theropod.
Tawa Hallae's bones of the spine were obviously also partly filled with air.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the scientists come to the conclusion that the saurians appeared there first.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the planet, which still formed a single land mass as the super continent Pangaea.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the planet, which still formed a single land mass as the super continent Pangaea.
This theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more theropods which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of Tawa Hallae.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
But there are of course contradictions.
An older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in what is today Poland, says the Bonn-based palaeontologist Martin Sander.
An older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in what is today Poland, says the Bonn-based palaeontologist Martin Sander.
He believes that a distorted picture may emerge simply because a high number of primitive dinosaur fossils have survived over the years, while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with a large amount of other reptiles, for instance with the ancestors of today's crocodile and pterosaurs and with numerous other saurians.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with a large amount of other reptiles, for instance with the ancestors of today's crocodile and pterosaurs and with numerous other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic period, the dinosaurs spread across the globe and developed many new species, while their relatives died out on the threshold from the Triassic to the Jurassic periods.
Success story did not last for ever
There may have been a case of mass dying, which the dinosaurs randomly survived but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adjusted, meaning that they were able to beat off the competition.

In any event, the success story did not last for ever.

The list is long and the signatories international.
278 professors and teaching assistants of the Goethe University, but also of colleges from all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are showing their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "to deligitimise and criminalise the protest" and distracts from the matter.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for their own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
We have sympathy for the protest, but cannot accept vandalism, said the CDU parliament member Peter Beuth.
There were several visits, and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Riedberg finally signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
Zelenograd is the headquarters to the most important Russian research institutes and companies.
Zelenograd (verbatim "green city") got its name from the wooded hills where the research facilities are located.
For its supporters, the project deals no less than with the "new heart of Europe".
And therefore, terminus stations were supposed to disappear: as in Frankfurt and Munich.
Even very ambitious planners have recognised that it is virtually unpayable to lower the stations in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria.
An urban area is being created which, if the planners' computer-generated graphics are to be believed, will feature a lot of green.
Contemporary traffic policy, however, should be prioritising the handling of freight transportation, as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lorry on the road.
Experts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic.

The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400+-page VGH verdict, said economics minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to reorganise the ban on night flights in the event of building the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticised this delay and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
It is bloody difficult when you are allowed to keep one's word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation from Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by "skewing justice and playing tricks".
The institutions thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limits on manager bonuses and the paying of high charges.

Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster is able to present his successor.
Yesterday evening, the committee wanted to vote on the appointment.
However, the plan not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this suggestion were also not successful with the board of directors, will also have played its part.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative board had signaled already weeks before the vote that they would not confirm Brender in office.
With the argument that ZDF's news broadcasts had lost viewers under Brender, he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the exercising of political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
He studied political and educational sciences and Romance studies.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatine prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should amend the ZDF treaty to the extend that staff suggestions of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by harshly criticising the committee immediately after it voted out Brender.

Politicians and colleges also want to simplify the recognition of exams taken between the colleges inside and outside Germany.
The so-called accreditation council has decided to, in part, dramatically reduce the number of exams: "Every module ends, as a rule, with an exam," states the 30-page paper, which is to newly govern the admission of courses in part.

The rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the review of existing courses.
They need to be "reaccredited" every five years, which, however, means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.
In some federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed on corresponding measures with the state ministries.
With this money, the colleges are, in particular, to set up tutor programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exams and foreign offices.

The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday.
On top of praise, there was also criticism for the decisions.
The federal board of the Young Socialist University Groups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university principals.

Going in and out of Germany is nice, virtually no checks..." is the first line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he describes in disturbing fragments a dissident's experience of arrival, who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area.
He caused a major extra-literary stir last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, debating "German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Securitate files".
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a part, said after Söllner's confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him.
Germany was a cosy habitat for the Security spies, as Herta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file, 914 pages.
A law regulating the administration of the files has only existed since 2005.

But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitchko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.
For Klitchko this was his third successful defence of his title since his comeback in October 2008.
Before, the Ukrainian had already twice been world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Klitchko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice he had to give in due to injury.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02-metre tall Klitchko aimed to dictate the match predominantly with his left hitting hand.
Overall, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and simply tried to survive the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitchko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
Nevertheless, he is only the second boxed since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 who fight the full twelve rounds against Klitchko.
The challenger had caused quite a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
I only took one blow in this fight, and am physically in very good shape, Klitchko said after the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all important titles in his family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
Haye had previously cancelled in the summer a fight planned to take place in September against Vitali Klitchko.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent revelations regarding the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has accused defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate deception.
The minister apparently made "knowingly false statements" regarding the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in September, said Green party head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme Tagesschau.
On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted tankers, but also to specifically kill two Taleban leaders.
The Greens, SPD and Left Party Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to address parliament immediately and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism resolutely.
Officially, it was said that they had lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister.
He has not received a response, it is claimed.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of parliament, which would be set up next Wednesday.

Some see images and hear voices when they are awake which others do not hear or see.
Not only in the mentally sick and during intoxication with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become blurred.
But anybody experiencing dream-like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake, is regarded in contemporary Western society as a madman or drug addict, or strange at the very least.
But such images and voices are formed not only in the mentally sick or during drug intoxication.
Conscious conditions which are warped like dreams can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if their triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shaman detachment from reality conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychoses.
Gravity no longer has any power over him
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and excessively gaudy.

Like dreams, a psychosis also opens the floodgates on a flood of ideas and phantasies, which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious.
The perception of reality in a psychosis is subject-centred, says professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic of Heidelberg.
But not everybody will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the sole factor.
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the sole factor.
We think that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy, for instance, explains Fuchs.
Environmental impacts also play a part - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychoses if the disposition is given.
When our brain runs hot
The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get the same, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psychosis.
In more recent studies, up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she is living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school.
When she answers him, her schoolmates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
She can even feel his presence, at least for some moments.
A pleasant feeling it is, she likes the boy.

If someone is socially isolated or suffers from sensory deprivation, he will very probably suffer from hallucinations after some time, says Kasten.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment.
Her hallucinations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father.
The hallucinations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psychosis.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
In our far too conscious-centred world, imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also brings positive aspects, creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation.
An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbearable situation, which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emptiness of a loss of consciousness.
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole's attempt to safe itself.

He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst noblemen who make intoxicants from blood.
These inner trips, Claussen believes, are fundamentally different from every dream.

This new campaign promoting helmet use in motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be,' will initially distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible.
Support for emergency braking is already obligatory
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this feature, 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even bigger -it estimates that one in four accidents injuring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which (via radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to lightly applying the brakes.

While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably the 8th- as reported by Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer is cautioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
It is not strange that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
One of them could be Geely, which aims to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is funded by the Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum.

It doesn't make sense that Ecofin saved Hungry from a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year, and thatit is going to let a euro member-country fail to fulfill its commitments.

Every day, thousands of cars that have been in accidents are towed to a garage, where a technician must evaluate the damage and what the repair will cost.
No claim is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, may take two or three hours.
The other firms in the sector, competing in the field of data assessment and processing, are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
When a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
In addition, a "smart" graphic is made for each model, where you can "click" on different parts of the car.
If it is a mass-market model, the work can be ready in a week, provided the process goes quickly.
Its national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, over a hundred technicians (usually expert mechanics) work with three computer screens at the same time.
The most common use focuses on maintenance and repair, but depending on the country, there are also tools to manage scrap pieces and to calculate the market and residual value of a car.
Besides the cost of parts, it includes manufacturer estimates of repair times and paint charts.
Then, every insurance company that makes thousands of assessments negotiates their price with Audatex.
You can study, for example, how many models of a particular make have gone to a shop because of malfunctions or how many have been in serious accidents in a certain period.
Its turnover has grown by 20% per year over the past three years, and it brought in 10.8 million euros in 2008.
This platform was created in Germany in 1996, and it manages more than 650,000 transactions throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 technicians.
With the AudaTaller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets an estimate in only 4 steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create an estimate and generate an estimate.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are cars, 109 sport-utility vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges and discounts, and can then print the estimate for the client.
AudaTaller is not an appraisal tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The cost of using this tool in a shop is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.

Female construction engineers and architects have thus the opportunity to combine their demanding jobs with child care.
As this is a "Mini-kindergarten," only 5 children may be present at the same time, even though more can attend in the course of the day altogether.
Children are not only playing here, they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for schooling and English is also taught here.
Parents can always check their child and it prevents stress situations related to delayed pick-up from nurseries located far from their parents" workplace.

The ground floor was leased to a jewelry.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space interconnection.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, along with blue and white glazed tiles used to line the inner courtyard and skylights.
It was enough to gamble on the principle that white reflects light more than dark colors, which absorb the sun's rays on the contrary.
Casa Batlló House, which was included in UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you have to quickly make friends with any of the inhabitants of the apartment house and visit them at home.
Otherwise you will have to fit into slatted bases into different heights, which may not be possible with every frame of the bed.
That's why experts refuse advertising slogans of life of the mattress up to 25 years, or even a lifetime warranty.
The pressure is spread into several points and the tension reduces.
Modern mattresses do have something in common with original mattresses filled with grasses.
Their manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least admixtures.
"Organic in mattresses means that the core is made of purely natural material," explains Petr Vasicek from the company Tropico Plus.

According to her it is questionable whether, in the event of an attack such a device would really help.
"The more expensive devices have in-built and tiltmeters, so even if one just skids and remains lying motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with location," says Czech.

And so, when the state offered the father of Charles Žďárského to rent a small workshop to compensate for the communists-confiscated property, he did not hesitate any long, rejected a career in the company, where he was working, and with a few friends around his father he founded the company producing plastic tubs.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even discharge employees," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take even such unpopular measures sometimes.
Revenues are growing again and so is the number of new employees.

Although gas will only be slightly more expensive, it will happen when most people are heating their flats and thus have the highest consumption.
If the rent does not change, Prague residents will pay extra 6.8 percent.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water rate should increase by about 7.4 percent.
For example, CPI Byty, which in Usti nad Labem owns about 2,500 apartments, plans to raise the rent from January by up to one hundred percent.

It is a surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
"Our results show that the relative finger length may serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for a man up to 60 years," said study's co-author Ros Eeles, Professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could then help determine which men should undergo tests for prostate cancer, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, she said.

Luciano pours the basic ingredients - milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers - into a large blender that heats the mixture to 85 degrees on an electronic programme and then immediately cools it to four degrees.
Anyone who talks about making ice cream "using natural ingredients only" has probably used stabilisers anyway - in most cases a natural product such as guar gum from guar beans.
Some variations to the base are allowed.
There are also powders and pastes.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
Luciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the types of fruit (vintners use it to measure the density of grape must using the Oechsle scale).
There is also a device that beats the finished ice cream mixture to a creamy consistency while cooling it to negative temperatures.

Stones have plenty of time.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen and a former French munitions depot where Manuel Rongen has created his own world of stone.
The 44-year-old trades in old stones.
People insulted and threatened him, he recalls, when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
He explained that there was nothing he could do about the demolition.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes - equivalent to 25 truck-loads.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.

Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new drilling off the coast of the US Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming year.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April was the trigger for the strict prohibition, which is to remain in force for at least the next five years.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the USA's biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his readiness to allow new drilling in the eastern area of the Gulf of Mexico.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the USA's biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his readiness to allow new drilling in the eastern area of the Gulf of Mexico.
Who will bear responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has still not been conclusively decided.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had revoked the prohibition on drilling imposed after the explosion.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out any further catastrophe with tougher controls and stricter safety regulations.
The responsible control authority, which fell into disrepute after numerous accusations of corruption, is being extensively reformed.
The industry is warning publicly that the output in the Gulf will be significantly lower than in the past if regulation is tougher.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the outcome of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm BDO - even before the prohibition on drilling was put in place on Wednesday.
People are living on theft, corruption and cooking illegal oil.

It seems that the soldiers, who mainly originate from the north of the country, also want to profit from oil, like all other Nigerians.

Thousands mourn lost friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have attended a memorial service for the miners declared dead after a series of explosions.
It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies.
The flags were flying at half mast at all government buildings in the country.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back "from the depths of the earth" to the surface, said the Prime Minister of New Zeeland John Key to the crowds at the memorial.

Great when a film has several target groups, but a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Since his wild and stylised drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," Director Winding Refn has been seen as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream by using a little more humour or to the art house by displaying less brutality.

The name turns up in IAEA documents when there is mention of the reactor Syria is alleged to have built in the cube-shaped building hidden in a valley cut off from the country's electricity network - with aid from North Korea.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that, although the CIA had known before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in El Kibar, it had not discovered any signs that there was "an active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Many intelligence officials in Europe are even more sceptical and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they believe the CIA presentation was "plausible."
Many intelligence officials in Europe are even more sceptical and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they believe the CIA presentation was "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how certain he is that a reactor exists this summer, a high-ranking UN diplomat replied laconically that the IAEA had "enough material to pose questions."
Hence, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity.
However, after analysing the particles, the IAEA rejected the claim as implausible.
So the investigation has continued since June 2008 without conclusion and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," according to a high-ranking western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - ultimately, a serious infringement of the non-proliferation treaty remains unresolved in the hands of the IAEA.
However, inspectors have not so far disclosed the nature of the facilities or what function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to information provided by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariya, referring to towns nearby.
A high-ranking western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production."
No one is admitting to having any information on where the rubble has ended up, as if hundreds of truckloads of earth had simply vanished into thin air.
Images from orbit, however, show that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had demanded access.

She wrote the script herself - a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
The rumour stubbornly persists that the woman - a Muslim - falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bakira Hasečić from the Association of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie herself is an ambassador for the UN agency.
They fledgling writer herself asserts that she has no political motives in her film, has read up on the Yugoslavian conflict assiduously and wants to show the horrific consequences of war and give a voice to all sides involved.
The fact that Jolie's film actually begins before the war is clear.
Now only the hackers from Hollywood can give her any peace by illegally posting the script on the web, as has been the fate of so many other scripts.

Crime has become a bigger worry than unemployment.
Those are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Because the poll has been taken regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in attitude across the region.
But only around half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's two most populous countries, are convinced democrats, which drags down the regional average (see chart 2).

The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients widens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
While researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"That makes it very peculiar, though it falls short of being some form of truly 'alien' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, targeted Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels.
The microbe does grow better on phosphorous, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.

Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal allegations arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal allegations arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
Because Mr. Hampton had recently been an aide to Mr. Ensign, he was barred by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
From the evidence that has been made public, "there appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate, and substantial violation of the revolving door statute," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was anything except a gift.

On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of a Cheshire, Conn., family, is set to come to an official end with the judge's imposition of the death sentence voted for by the jury.
"As I experienced it during this trial, I think there's a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting an individual's fair-trial rights," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes's chief defense lawyer.
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms might make trials fairer.
The defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudiced when Judge Blue declined to allow them to test potential jurors' reactions by showing them grisly crime-scene photographs during jury selection.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a juror who had been critical of prosecutors and that he improperly added pressure for a verdict by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than reports delivered more slowly was a Luddite view that would make poor court policy governing coverage of future trials.
In their filing, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the trial coverage and made it clear they would claim that the new media required new rules.
After a campaign notable for invective and negativity, a modicum of civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthroughs on the big issues that must be dealt with during the lame-duck session.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months produced a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gulf that still separates the members.
Both sides are now in a period of testing - probing one another for signs of cooperativeness and compromise while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for renewed partisan warfare.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, compromise is likely on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans can't afford to look like they favor tax cuts for the wealthy while denying jobless workers unemployment compensation.

Wehner, too, expressed skepticism - which is widely shared - that civility will lead to real cooperation.
The reasons have much to do with the makeup of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea party voters who were instrumental in creating it.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their own estimation, forced the issue of the deficit onto the public agenda in ways that can't be ignored.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal issues there is, today at least, little grounds for or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed later by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to stalemate, as it did in 1995, then both parties will be carefully watching the public reaction.
Whoever is judged to be losing is likely to shift course and seek compromise.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there appears to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans then.
At the same time, activists in both parties see 2010 as mere prelude to a more consequential election in 2012.
Given that reality, the civility on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans.

Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of the organization's former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalties are finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a joint U.N. and Cambodian tribunal handed down its first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the onetime chief of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, from 1975 until 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
But in the mid-1990s, after a U.N.-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had held out, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.

"These people have benefited very little following the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin trying Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had supervised construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
As the sun cast long shadows across the parched grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her past in the Khmer Rouge.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he has said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.

It distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Education Ministry's high school history textbook, which contains fewer than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.

The deal was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusan Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit here.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusan research facility.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
"Welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that enhanced respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains central to improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," it said.

The investigators calculate that the cell, during the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and soon distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its " combatants" can cross the European borders and the ones of other western countries with total impunity.
However, it should be mentioned that days before this committed attack, from Catalonia there were sent through an agency of transferences about some thousands of dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile phone cards that soon were used by the members of the "commando" that ended the life of 106 people.

Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
Without losing part of his reputation as champion driver, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the power of the Renault motor that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 " the secret weapon that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull in order to turn it into a winning team has become a legend.
Plm has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi or the most famous utilitarian cars of Nissan.
Russwurm explains that the team in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during every season.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and elements of security are being modified.
The changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems by means of laser and autoclaves of high tech.

This year has caught 250.000 particular clients and 50.000 companies.
"Next year everything will move," he assured.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and all the rest.
Germany has drawn up a red line that does not warrant crossing.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the violating countries will be severely sanctioned, can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector also will support part of the cost.
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction, with enormous deficits in the balance of payments, as the one faced by Spanish growth during the years of the boom, will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And the worst thing than we could do in these circumstances is to kid ourselves.
But the red line that Germany has drawn up there it is, and it does seem that is going be moved.
As we all know, a few minutes before the end of the game (that their team had already won), both players deliberately wasted time which made the referee show the second yellow card to both of them.
This way, and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group, both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league, against Auxerre, and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase.
The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
However, the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally characterize as legal fraud, because the violation of the rules was not made secretly as to try to avoid the sanction, but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the referee.
They waited for and accepted the sanction with no complaints.
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment.
Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse, in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wittiness.
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
The business will go "well for those who give quality for good price and with good attendance," he adds, and reminds that the clients tend to come down one step once with the crisis, so that the strip around the 25 Euros has become a demand for the majority.

All that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which it is difficult to have certainty on any of the facts.

His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
Obama himself has ordered to a high person in charge with the antiterrorism fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document leaks.
The attempt by the spokesman of President Barack Obama to reduce the attention paid to Assange contrasts with opinions that politicians and commentators now proclaim.

His brief message maintains open a cybernetic link with an ampler document that asks the public to immediately communicate with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent.
The message was disclosed after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless it is approved the extension of cuts of taxes of the Bush era and the financing of the government.

Another republican who was in favour, John McCain, has not defined his position at this moment.

Thus, American diplomats are astonished that every Canadian elector does not have Canado-American relations at heart when voting and believe that the visit by President Obama helped the Conservative government to have its 2009 budget adopted!
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, since the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Your journey will help ensure the government's survival of the vote of confidence at the start of February on the federal budget, which will post Canada's first deficit for over ten years due to a relaunch plan of 30 to 40 thousand million dollars," writes Mr. Breese.
The ambassador is worried by broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligece and H2O, which contain unsubtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No Fly List" or again to kidnappings for rigorous interrogation by the CIA.

According to the plan tabled yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still hold 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs, or better still, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or LED in English), the bulk of the 1.8 thousand million tonnes of GES emitted on the planet to provide illumination for human beings, would be avoided.
Illumination is responsible for 8% of worldwide emissions.
The new DEL bulbs such as those launched by Philips this week, Philips having morepover participated in a UNO study, have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than incandescent bulbs, giving an idea of the saving, which would be possible in a plan of replacement applicable to 100 countries.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have voiced revervations concerning fluocompact bulbs, because they contain mercury and because it is necessary to dispose of them as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers issue instructions.

Lastly, they place in a glaring light the way in which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give credence of the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad played a central part in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to arrange to repatriate their own nationals detained in Iran.
"Do it all the more when the Iranians ask you not to."
M. Richier adds that arresting foreigners is a familiar Iranian tactic, taking hostages for political blackmail.
He said that the Iranians might arrest in the near future another of some 1800 French citizens who live in Iran.

On what is based so much "gratitude" epressed to M. Assad, asks the Paris embassy.
Notwithstanding their declarations full of praise, French officials privately admit that they only have the vaguest notion of what the Syrians really did.
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elysée put out this fiction.

If you visit a library devoted to American publications, you will see that every work repeats (concerning the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosicrucians) exactly that which was already set out in earlier works.

Top secret information about Berlusconi, which the Amereican embassy in Rome sent to the State Department, was the same as that which Newsweek had published the week before.
Secondly, the idea of a hacker being able to acquire the deepest secrets of the most powerful country in the world represents a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker as the citizen's avenger, can learn all the secrets of power.
How can a power last, if it can no longer keep its secrets?
Clearly, in future, States will no longer be able to place on line secret information, which would be like posting it on a street corner.
But it is also clear that with current technologies it is useless to hope to be able to discuss confidential reports on the telephone.
Video cassettes (analogue) had enabled cinema research workers to explore a film step-by-step going backward and forward and discovering all the secrets of montage, whilst digital CD's only allow jumping from chapter to chapter, namsly by macroportions.

A Stylist Must Also Be a Good Psychologist, Professionals Claim
This time, together with Alenka, the Director, (there is not a single man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry.
We were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist, and not to dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth to have at least one piece custom-made.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth to have at least one piece custom-made.
You will definitely not regret the investment, as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a custom-made skirt, you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting, rolling up, sticking out in your waist, etc.
Boyish figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruffling, appliqué, embroidery, or shirring.
Inside I rejoice, as she is so much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a ton (please, understand I am exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
Now I also know that in the picture, a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality.
Just look at Madonna, who is no miraculous singer, yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star.
The adventure opens very well.
This means each race takes place on a different route, and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments.
Individual races are ordered fairly well.
In contrast with the driving model, the collision model is not that good.
This is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily, while when you get there, the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You have to watch out for gas stations along the way, as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant, sometimes even great.

There is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow.
However, Hašek's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers, unable to agree on a common candidate.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fiasco.
"I don't poke my nose in what I don't understand either,' said Paclík, who gained a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of board of referees, led by Luděk Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
"Right after that, I would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors, to ensure enough money for the whole football," the forty-six year old candidate told ČTK two months ago.

"Football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the crucial day of his career of a functionary, remains an optimist.
He wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas.
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
"Processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said, in fear that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, situation f the Association might return to the period before Hašek.
"This would prevent the current situation, where there are just three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem concerning young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
"He wouldn't want to twist things for his own benefit," Rajchl said about his rival.

According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schumann, shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger.
The campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way.
However, most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
However, most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
The investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board of managing directors - with recommendations for action.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices," said Bode.
Ackermann's sensitive response is at first surprising, but then the CEO would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office.
One in two people would withdraw commodities investments
To date, more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organisation's campaign.
No more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank.
Austria's pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, is a famous textbook example of modern post-war architecture with its clear shapes, glass halls, bold strokes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress.
It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next world's fair.
It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next world's fair.
Nonetheless, it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new home.
The building stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now renovated the pavilion, which has been named the "21er Haus" and will be used as a contemporary art museum.
Agnes Husslein-Arco who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007 was instrumental in the new beginning.
He was known, of course, for having renovated and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna, and had won the competition, but he also studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was an "exceptionally important place" for him where had visited exhibitions "almost every weekend."

The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, fibreglass-reinforced safety glass was put in and the glass roof was replaced by high-grade safety glass.
Two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, a sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the delicate Schwanzer pavilion.

Investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
His investment holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has become one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
He praised the management, which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis.
The computer pioneer - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett had avoided technology firms to date.
His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries.
His lifestyle, however, has remained humble,
"Big Blue," as IBM is also known, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft.
One newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now resurfacing.
For many German Turks, the news brings back to life a long-dead spectre. There has been no comparable right-wing extremist violence against Turks since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993.
Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish Community in Berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
"Peace in Germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is uncovered and on the appropriateness of punishment," writes "Selen."
The attacks on Mölln and Solingen in the 90s are an example of what it means for peace in Germany to be at risk.
No other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is imminent danger and shown the Germans that mistrust and distance can culminate in real violence.
The coverage by the Turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the current German state has become since.

Axel Weber was clearly delighted, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues.
All at once, he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of "Europe's biggest banking scandal."
UBS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years.
UBS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years.
It began in the financial crisis.
As a result, in 2007 UBS was managing 1.6 billion, thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
and had risen to the league of the world's biggest banks as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly stepped down.
The investment division of the bank had gambled on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions.

UBS announced a capital increase, believe it or not, of 13 billion Swiss francs to face the crisis.
The bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel - the second best paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.

The National Bank bought up toxic securities from UBS for untold billions and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a mandatory convertible bond to become part owner of the bank.
After all, the balance sheet total for UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland (see chart).
"We would not be able to save the UBS for a second time," says banking researcher Geiger.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with the USA and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty.
The bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion.
"The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economic and professor of finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability, just as Lindt and Sprüngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate.
The location alone is classic.
The bank has its head office on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake, surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.

"That Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow.

The internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an almighty wheel.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
It led the "league tables" that documented the success of the banks at that time.
To plug the hole, UBS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in US subprime securities.
It developed into a vast machine that packaged up securities based on US mortgage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks.
One manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated.
Posts at UBS became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy to the world on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss banker was actually only imagined as a transitional solution when the bank parted ways unexpectedly with his predecessor Grübel.

Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
A few of these people will become heroes.
A few will become prisoners of war, or lose limbs, go mad or die.
This is a moving book, almost from the start.
In telling a German schoolgirl's story he says: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
Conversely a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die, and that no one will notice or care.
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Mr. Englund writes, "a war between factories."
In dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war has "unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
The best books about World War I have often been oblique, like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory," or novels, like Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," rather than comprehensive histories.
His book has the most devastating ending I can remember in a piece of nonfiction.
But it's as if he has reached from his book, snatched that dramatis personae page from your fingers, and lighted it with a match.
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On Oct. 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans.
On Oct. 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans.
The lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to cow many protesters.
Reporters in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said it was for their safety.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
A second group of officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to move in.
Barricades were set up at Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and at Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from Zuccotti Park.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, District Council 37, in its effort to reverse the layoffs.
At a City Council hearing last month, Schools Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in June.

Mission over, Congress ready to agree on Libya
It finally looks like Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the revolt to succeed, longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and American involvement to end.
The language may sound innocuous, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties squabbled with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the U.S. military's role in the NATO mission in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came up for a vote in the Senate.
Then Congress's indecision was overtaken by events.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this Congress, spanning a wide range of topics.
Some of those bills are identical too, but they give their sponsors - particularly freshmen Republicans looking to burnish their resumes - the chance to brag that they "authored" such a measure.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Rep. José E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Rep. José E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the nullification of federal laws if they are opposed by two-thirds of the states.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they're not moving at any faster pace than in past years.
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years, according to numbers provided by the Senate Library.

Appearing on ABC News's "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formed sentences and needed help walking.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt-ceiling deal.

The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special that aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting up in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who goes through two hours of therapy every day, said she has no memory of the day of the shooting.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The black-tie crowd rose to its feet and cheered.
"The servicemen and women were regarded as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise comes with a price, service members say.
"We aren't victims at all," said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.

They also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member's suffering.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one.

This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will anxiously await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Va., that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
"The military is a top-down structure," she says.
Per a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by active-duty personnel.

Her group filed a suit in December against the Veterans Administration, charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system.

"We realized that it wasn't that difficult to get to them at all," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years.
DEMOS's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, the Facebook "data supernova" is generating a research boom, driving the number of academic papers with the site's name in the title up almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn't approach with a clipboard on the street.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison and her colleagues found that undergraduates who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
While researchers have well-defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline, online it's a free-for-all.

Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he came to the top Pentagon job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices.

Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it's willing to reroute the project to get it back on track.

In his lecture A technological view of the pothole, issued under the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt, but with a better mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid at 120° C, its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius has a nearly solid state, whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile, he said.
If it were modified asphalt it would spread even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt covering, he added, is placed a final layer called rolling covering, which is made ​​of a fine stone material, meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt.

Hundreds of protesters were crowding round in front of Zuccotti square to camp.
The members of the movement Occupy Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, in the Manhattan Square where they were evacuated at dawn when trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the movement "Occupy Wall Street," Mark Bray.

Bray explained that the response of the "angry persons" to the evacuation of the camp issued personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain camped.
Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to do harm to others" as "Some businesses had received threats' and neighbors feared" for the quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning was disgusting and shows that deep inside Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "disrespect for the freedom of expression."

The government of the great social democratic /Christian democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and so avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign credit rsting (triple A).
"If the solvency of Austria had not fallen by a single notch,from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three thousand million Euros of interest more every year," argued the vice-chancellor and Christian democratic foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger.

As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron, remind us in a recent book summarising the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, mai 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries, which admit immigrants.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to, rather than replacements of, local labour, exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors, which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment.
Th World Labour Organisation estimates that for example in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30, will make a net contribution (receipts less expenditure) of an average of 150,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime.
Europe invented democracy, thinks in terms of European democracy
The European crisis, which we are passing through, is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them, because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe.

Gazprom, the giant Russian gas producer, wanted to celebrate the event with a "bang."
That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive.
But at the price of depriving Europe of energy, since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe.
Russia has succeeded in less than five years, in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries, which consume large quantities of gas, and whose deposits are declining.
"This gasduct is a component of partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which links us organically," confirmed François Fillon inaugurating the gasduct, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, present in large numbers at Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.

Another study, this time a European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options available, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life threatening, and opting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening.
In collaboration with the Société internationale d'urologie [SIU], Movember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure.
In our world, there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time.
However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics.

These bosons, it must be stressed here, are not all such exotic bugs as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this article, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon, or the "light particle" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, rather like a pebble thrown in a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the "force carrier" bosons.
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for the boson to appear.
Which is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a 27km circumference! - is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do so have mass, while the others (such as the photon) do not.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!).

It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life, be it at home, in hospital or in a care home.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia.
At the very end of life, physicians then often resort to palliative sedation, which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.

Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as 'credits', used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
How does the network operate?

Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it, then "hash" it all up.
Once this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check that it is the right one.
If a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different imprints.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible down to the hundred millionth, which leaves some margin...
"The loophole used is not the protocol itself" says Pierre Noizat reassuringly, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless payment by mobile, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.

Only the "high and mighty" make it to Moscow: migrants save money for language
A new law came into effect on December 1, which obliges every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Services.
"They are promised one thing at home, but when they arrive, they are lied to, their passports are taken, they are not paid what they were promised," confirms the Head of the Main Migrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Nonetheless, many citizens of Central Asian countries, who plan to go to work in Russia, admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good, but they can barely write in their own language.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles.
On the first day of the law's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake.
Naturally, they were not free for their owners: each of the migrants, who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them.
For the moment, the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012, whereas 1,168,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period.

So many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day, and during the period Walmart sold about 5000 products a second.
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart (they're not so welcome in the progressive city, that is why they don't exist here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
Nobody earns less in this expensive city.
Now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald's employees, who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
Participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald's on 40th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars/hour, i.e. more than double their present wages.
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry.

Rosbalt continues the project St. Petersburg Avant-garde, dedicated to residents who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed all in red, who can be seen by the Russian Museum, or by the Summer Garden, or at fashionable parties and shows.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, image-maker and society.
I'm drawn to theatre, clothing, music, all genres except for literature.
Shnur and his friends lip sang easy songs, wearing tight leotards, and the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin was with them.
When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad.

The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant.
Caravans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet?
There are only two actual planets that can be explored even hypothetically.
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life, Venus has 500-degree temperatures.
Half a century ago, experiments were run on plants.
But then the problem begins.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space with foetus.
"This was on bio-satellites, but again, it was a singular experiment and such research needs to be conducted," says Vladimir Sychev.
Animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct, when they're out of their familiar environment.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, very few cosmonauts, who were OK and had healthy children after long flights.
And yet, humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
In principle, it is logical, because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing.
However, with time, it will become reality, when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their offspring, who were born in space.
"The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, commenting on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors.
"The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce," asserts Kala.
This is about parallel auditing, which we began around two years ago.
Since we carry out our audits ex-post, a certain delay has to be taken into account.
The Law must be set out one way or the other, and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce.
On the other hand, it is a tragedy, when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a technicality.
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.

The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice, which might occur at higher altitudes of the Pardubice region in particular.
In Eastern Bohemia the day will be mostly clear to partly cloudy, and dry.
The D5 motorway is drivable almost without restriction, but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80th and 131st kilometre marks.
Besides certain snow-covered places, or some icy frost patches, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the Usti nad Labem region is also closed, according to the police database.
Together with The Tap Tap band, we tend to joke about it, saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely.
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists.
The Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people.
Public respect or accessibility is one thing, but it is only when we can become famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers that things will really begin to change.
Since I am a musician myself - among others I play the saxophone - I started a music club with a colleague.
But that pity is simply wasted, because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings, who need to be pitied.
But that pity is simply wasted, because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings, who need to be pitied.

Polish boffins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War, but were not always met with understanding.
Gadomski became a world-known promoter of astronautics and his contribution was, notably, recognised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
Immediately prior to the War, all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that coordinated all the work.
Immediately prior to the War, all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that coordinated all the work.

Poland also participated in the Interkosmos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
The whole situation is bolstered by the businessman's complete unwillingness to pay taxes, which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data.
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage.
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag.
Liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin.
Private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy.
Private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy.
The proof is the existence of the almost omnipotent, and in all states, omnipresent lobby.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption, through mutual benefits and legislation, where almost everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany the situation is such that state ministries, through lack of financial resources, contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms, who are basically connected with industry.
It is clear that liberally-orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation, as is described by Appian in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Cesar and Pompei: "The State was already long in complete degeneration and its offices taken by force.
The outcome is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms.
The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well as crimes against humanity, as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history.
Under the pressure of economic competition, internationally as well as within Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population's living standards.
"If my sons did not want war, there would be none," said the dying Gutle Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people, who had chosen their path independently, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-calculated goal.
We must accept that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation's lifespan.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered the puppet master (whether someone else stands above them, I am unsure, but I would not rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stake, they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained, but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government).
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began to issue his own (that is state-issued) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre.
The first war was to remove the large monarchic state bodies in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially from Great Britain, and the third will reduce the world's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury, and will not use up so many resources), the creation of one universal faith (ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution), and finally the seizing of absolute power.
The method, which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the way, employ is the instigation of crises, followed by the offering of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions are false, however, and always lead to a worse situation (vide establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated).
The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unsubstantiated, with German capitulation (the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia) and the central European powers of Austria-Hungary were subsequently dismantled.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but on an international level (just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the wrong-doer and who is the victim in the Palestine-Israel conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence, while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power?
Israel's current prime minister, Netanyahu 'the hawk', is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to instigate war with Iran, which would, due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...) lead to a greater threat of global conflict, and through its control of the Hormuz Strait, where 20% of the world's oil must sail (the channel is only 2 miles wide), to the destruction of the world's economy.
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristocrats.
A world, where each new-born is implanted with a chip, which makes their existence completely subjugated.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the USA, which had actually supported his regime for several decades.
The incarcerated diplomats were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Affleck's film is a peculiar mix of genres.
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables, in office corridors, over the phone...
The derided actor has become a respected director, and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments.

The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid, creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise, which come flooding in, as history suddenly takes a turn.
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail-biting scenes for the film.

What little there is, is worked well, with some occasional embellishments to reality - these do not all come off so elegantly (the scene, where a looming crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America, followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-fetched).
Argo's weakness is its divergence, which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places.
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU."
Norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU despite opposition from certain states, referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives.
One possible prize-winner in the poll may be the last year's EU regulation according to which inflatable balloons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blowers.
The Bankovnipoplatky.com server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association, Laissez Faire, also nominated, aside from the aforementioned absurdities, for example the Union's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state.
The poll's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline, or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding.
"We are handicapped because we do not have the sea.
The Czech Republic is further away from a port, so according to Palas the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros.
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Emotions flare among Czechs when, just as other countries in the Union, the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products, in which it does not always succeed.
People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
If everything in our country worked without problems, then I would not be running for any post.
You have already reached the Senate, but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle.
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senate's elections.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence, and the strongest mandate possible.
As president, though, you do not have this power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
As president, though, you do not have this power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
The problem is political squabbling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right, it will be deliberately rejected, causing delays for the public.
The advantage I hold is that without the political pigeonholing or dogmas I can take what is best for our country from any side, and apply it.
From the Czech viewpoint, it seems they tend to put me to the left.
I always support any good public solutions, even if they are put forward by the KSCM or the ODS, and, in the same way, I will oppose bad ideas.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere, or they have been put forward by experts.

You have no money?
I have the Aston Martin, by the way, because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant with women and also fought against evil and villainy.
You drive an Aston Martin, have assets worth 60 million, but you have no money for a campaign?
I do not have 15 million for a campaign.
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme.
People would like me to be a Samaritan, who saves the Republic.
And if I became president, then I would end my business activity.
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town outside the gates of Rotterdam, which barely merits a visit, is a special record-holder.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses, with a total of 50 dwellings.

There is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif, however, the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot.
The interior space, glazed throughout, is bright and open, the fired clinker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square.
The urban ambiance is perfect.
We turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out.
Even die-hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials.
"Here we wanted to work with recyclable materials," explained Joop Trouborst, Project Manager for the Municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the Standard.
The thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste.
For the library, the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-centimetre-thick boards.
At the end of the 500-meter-long journey, you are rewarded in the Literature Café, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
These provide atmosphere, but most importantly, regulate the air humidity in the literary mountain range.

"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain bond with this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
This is ultimately a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, due to their special relationship with Israel, Germany must be cautious.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel.
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy.
So what specifically does a "normal" foreign policy entail, from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters, which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, that is, by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Near East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
On the one hand, Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East, and particularly in the Gulf States.
In any case, this plays a role.
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya.
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative.
The USA, on the other hand, have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto.
I think that secretly, the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahu's policies.
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case.
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European position.
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role.
If we look at the Euro crisis for example, every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role, various anti-German feelings become apparent.
It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing, yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum, so who is filling the gap?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he has specialised in German policy, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations.

The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing.
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to information from market research company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros annually, China is the third largest market for luxury items, and the fastest growing.
Pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases, because after a long period of time, the name to which the objection is being raised has become a "market reality."
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
As is so often the case in China, the figures are imposing.
For more than seven years, the group has been contesting against a Chinese plagiarist.
For more than seven years, the group has been contesting against a Chinese plagiarist.
However, the copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
The CTMO trademark office then also dismissed the Munich-based company's appeal.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high six-figure sum in euros" as settlement.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spilling over, back into Europe.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This is a business sector that the group had long vacated, yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, rather foreigners should also register "everything" that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well," said Wentzler.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano surge, beguile and haunt.
"Om'Obani" is by no means a simple piece, with each voice having a different text, and in an extremely foreign language at that: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
70 of these attend a secondary school.
This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Gogo Centre.
In Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller or worshipper.
For almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign, 'soft' language, and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa.

Forty percent are infected.
Around 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus.
More than forty percent of people in the Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in you mid-thirties is by no means rare.
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005, the Choir visited the village, but first and foremost, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well: food, clothing, education.
However, just one year later, the choir established the "Voices for Africa" Association, which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni at an almost professional level.
Crabs and scabies belong among the parasitic STIs.
The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
This is around one tenth fewer than the previous year.
Which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, often they cause no pain or any other symptoms, thus remaining undetected.
Condoms can reduce the risk of contraction, however, they do not offer 100% protection.
Condoms can reduce the risk of contraction, however, they do not offer 100% protection.
Therefore, first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured and assertive woman, manages the money from Germany.
The Gogos, as the old ladies are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school,built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organisation, PSI, organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-esteem, which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.

A bus full of white people, who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy, but some grim-faced border soldiers even shed a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their sponsor children.
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map, it is more than well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The US space agency, NASA, has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The US space agency, NASA, has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow.
This is thought to be at east 30 centimetres and perhaps up to 20 metres thick.
However, no-one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Chief Scientist for the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.

The photo taken by the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the Cepheus constellation.
The nebula, 1,400 light years away, consists of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust.
This image was put together from the X-ray images captured by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the Earth.
Researchers presume that it only came into being shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen.
The telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used the device to observe the stars one year later.
The mirror, shown in the image, had a diameter of five metres.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canarian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to reduce costs.
In spite of this it achieves a diameter of around eleven metres.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also focus on the medial infrared spectrum.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also focus on the medial infrared spectrum.
Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, images are not to be expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of thirty metres.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest.
Scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger orbits around the planets much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.

The fabulous wealth, for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank, has not yet arrives here in the province.
Yet Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May due to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world," said Fatulayeva.
She is the Director of the Museum of Longevity, most likely the only of its kind in the world.
However, the unrivalled star of the museum is shepherd Shirali Muslimov who is said to have lived to 168 years old.

The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this as being due to the special Talysh genetics.
However the notion that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either.

The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely disputed.
We must make the transition.
However, Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a Doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save.
In actual fact, the 234 articles, which have been pushed through by the Islamic-dominated 110-person Constituent Assembly, are in some aspects cause for concern.
"The revolution is back"
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo, in unfamiliar unity, and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect.
Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belongs "on the rubbish tip of history."
"If he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said member of the opposition Jasser Said.
"We have not yet grown tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," stated the Egyptian media, quoting opposition politician Chaled Ali.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafis took part, shouting out: "The people demand the application of God's law."

A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have most likely provoked events verging on civil war.

"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on rather a long bus journey.
Rakfisk is a product of very different, poverty-stricken times in Norway when, pre-refrigeration, fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by plentiful jobs, high wages and a comprehensive care system.

"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says Anna our waitress, handing round trays of maturing rakfisk and, with her long blond hair and startlingly blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being.
Her English, like that of most people here, is flawless.
We are not very showy, we do not like ostentation.
When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have, in the years leading up to the global financial crash, Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound.
"And eat rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rakfisk.
The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rakfisk dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nasally challenging - fish.
There is a live TV link up to a compere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfisk.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
A congested city at the best of times, a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the running of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.

I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change.
Particularly in terms of security and the economy, we're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs.
After an unbroken 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is much expectation within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo couldn't be sharper.
And the problems in the municipality are also gritty and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly acute.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly acute.
On a patch of wasteland by a vast landfill site, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a concrete home typical of the rundown neighbourhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
There were signs she'd been beaten, and rigor mortis had already set in.
The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossip, a trouble-maker, a whiner.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office.
"I hope he's the same kind of president as he was a governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.

That, however, is exactly what victims' families in Ciudad Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, prosecutors contend
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses.
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier.
The military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the brig at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself but hadn't done so.

My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans have a firmer grasp of who they are and Mexican-Americans resent that.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're a part of either.
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.
If at least some Mexicans aren't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that.

The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace

Jubilant Hamas people say an Islamist crescent is curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hizbullah party-cum-militia holds sway, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bashar Assad, and on down through Jordan, where Hamas's allies are menacing the king.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.

By contrast, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas's missiles have been destroyed.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Why coddle those twisty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
Israelis too should look to the longer term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.

Cigarette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
Smoking warnings and diseased body parts emblazoned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say the laws have boosted their business.
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.

In a Constantly Plugged-In World, It's Not All Bad to Be Bored
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of boredom.
It forces the brain to go on interesting tangents, perhaps fostering creativity.
"Boredom actually has a very long history," he said.
What separates boredom from apathy, he said, is that the person is not engaged but wants to be.
What separates boredom from apathy, he said, is that the person is not engaged but wants to be.
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we just have difficulty concentrating.
To help measure this, researchers developed a "Boredom Proneness Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests, I don't have time to do everything."
Using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes needing more, and a variety of, external stimulation.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty jaded lot.
But he said he did know that "adolescence is a peak period for boredom," largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
Your kid doesn't just learn to entertain himself, but gets more self-control in other areas.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chatter of activity and technology.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug paraphernalia - petty offenses that each carry a $100 fine - and given a court date.
"We get treated like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location.
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which approved a similar measure.
But prosecutors in more conservative precincts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession.
"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
On Nov. 21, Chief Oates in Aurora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older, and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes "effective immediately."
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In northern Colorado's Weld County, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales, they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.

It is not just today's university students who are attacked for their views
Yet, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late Eighties to read history, I'd packed my bags, precipitating the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
Friends were baffled.
The truth was less droll.
Such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal-rights protection as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Their situation wasn't helped by a recent BBC Two documentary, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about student politics, which portrayed Tories as oddballs and neo-Nazis.
The atmosphere would have made a Stalinist shudder with apprehension.
A small man with a face like cake batter, Pitt was big on bile.
The other undergraduates giggled.

When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.

"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"

On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Couture," an exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other of the Italian designer's famous clients.
Somerset House, former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition.
"I love this palace" he says, in his unmistakable Italian accent.
"I love this palace" he says, in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "signore" Garavani, although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went for dinner at his flat.
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of well reciprocated love.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "gilet" waistcoat and jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift he gave me" says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
Their proportions are perfect.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless" says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
It took four months' work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create the pearl-encrusted, ivory-coloured silk gown with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half metres long.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was on the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
If a princess says that...

After breaking off large sulphur rocks, which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there, at snail's pace, keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice.

Once at the top, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then, lugging their heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down, 1,850 metres above sea level.

Punished for life, this pleasant, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesn't stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to save costs, nor has it provided any equipment for the porters, who work for themselves and by the kilo.
"This work is for animals, not people" protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos, ensuring that he will go on working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 [months?] and 10 years old.

I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no-one complains of serious illnesses... apart, of course, from their common respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and sores on the shoulders, which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets.
Every day, he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, which three lorries move to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away along a goat path that passes through scrubland.

Singaporeans blame their careers, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advert for mint sweets, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.

Singapore is a rich, high technology city State in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, known as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
"This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family" he explains.
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses.
However, he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers, who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project.
"But, for me, it is important to have my own money and time" says another young man of around 20 years old.
So, much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, the Singaporeans have the last word.

Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian Government.
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more details.
The ASPA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which on Monday, at The Hague, will start to hear the arguments of both parties, in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts" added Piñera, greeting Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and creating new economic networks" said the Peruvian President in a message read out.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, between the coast and Brazil, and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous, peaceful and integrated nation, with good neighbourly relations, was another issue highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
"We will review all these paths, [which] are not exclusive, and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua" he emphasised.
Correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
"That would complicate the health of any person" he added.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is handling a series of cases in different European courts" he said.
"The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians, but bad journalists depending on profit, blackmail and extortion" he said.

Conflict is inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
Personally, I've never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result: HIV positive.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (CHG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health.
At that time, having Aids was synonymous with death.
However, many people are still unaware of their illness, and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
However, many people are still unaware of their illness, and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world, at least since the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal" stated the head of the CHG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.
To gauge this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
That's how I view it, and that's how it's been at our hospital.
Specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree on this proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to be tested at a private laboratory, motivated only because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications.

There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
92% of new infections are through sex, 6% via the bloodstream and 2% perinatal.

However, the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles.
Indeed, the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitrator.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
What is also certain is that, not including the votes of subsidiaries, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the US courts, namely "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, did not achieve a majority.
The real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, noting that the latter discharged itself with adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
Moreover, it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, ensuring fairness for debtors and creditors.

The resources were apparently channelled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administradora Profesional de Hoteles.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry.
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, and the matter has already been archived.
As you know, the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility, deeming it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
The issue is the first of four identical issues which are offering to repay interest every 28 days.
Basketball globetrotter Hector "Hetin" Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, travelled the world.
"I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager and federative president of the National Team during the '90s," recalled Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for over 50 years.
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his long career, which goes to prove it.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me 'I've got a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall.
The Vaqueros' championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but from a distance, because in 1988 he was already becoming a federative bigshot.
For that time, he preferred to enjoy his own and Mincy's accomplishments in the national team.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it should have been bronze, but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
However, my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and gave the US team a beating, which was quite similar to the time we won bronze at the World Cup.
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members, but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with, was the 1995 Pre-Olympic team in Neuquen, Argentina.
His numbers at international tournament level are awesome.
Of the youngsters, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon predator JR Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.

Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT.
Hagman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early '50s, and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956, in England.
While there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu, home to many celebrities.
After his liver transplant, he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital, helping fearful patients.
He was also an anti-smoking activist and took part in several campaigns.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice some called "debt Armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, where end-of-the-world Christians theorists think the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever" said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.

At the main Pennsylvania State University campus, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an Associate Art History and Anthropology Professor, have teamed up to give a course, called simply "The end of the world."
"We don't add '2012' so we always have the option of running the course again, if the world doesn't come to an end" said Restall.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end" said Restall.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.

Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which is to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "sometimes life doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope for".
He and Kerr still love each other, emphasised the 36-year-old.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.

The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.
While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.

Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.
A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.
That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.
"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.

Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.
"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
"We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible," said Mayor Jens Häußler, opening the citizen's information event regarding the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
The masses of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no such thing as absolute protection, but we can attempt to make a relative improvement," said Häußler.
However, Häußler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed.
Among other measures, the protection concept, which (we reported) has already been presented to the Town Council during the past week, plans local measures in the tributary to the River Irm, running from the Stammheim Valley.

In conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among others, the question was raised as to why embankments and detention reservoirs are no longer planned to protect the location.

The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.
The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.

For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.
After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.

But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.
"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.
The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.

When the year comes to an end in just eight weeks, the anniversary year will be upon us.
A deed was drafted in Kirchen, in which both towns are mentioned.
On 15 March, the anniversary year will be officially launched, and because Geisingen currently has no suitable venues, this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary celebrations, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen.
Town Musical Director, Rudolf Barth, has composed a commissioned piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
The deed was drawn up in Kirchen (Hausen), which at the time was the location of the courthouse.
In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama's signature health care law is constitutional.

The government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syrian airforce base
On Thursday, an American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, made a statement to American news broadcaster CNN, stating that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an airforce base in the Syrian town of Latakia the day before.
The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was fired upon during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were identified as the responsible party.
Israeli television broadcaster Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, in which Russian S-125 Newa-type defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads weighing up to 70 kilograms.

Unsure, the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, press agency Reuters has also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack, but was not sure.
In any case, a spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said: "We are not commenting on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, writing for daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, emphasised that the Syrian regime had already previously attempted, in some cases successfully, to deliver ground to air missiles to Hezbollah.

A group belonging to the "Schweizer Wiese" citizen's initiative has given the hoarding on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb a face-lift.
In addition, they have cleaned and widened the footpath, a press release announced.
Their motto, on the large billboard stated "We are against unfinished buildings".
In so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese - should the huge project one day fail.
Chatting with many people passing by the "construction site", it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town, although many have the same questions as the citizen's initiative regarding the scale of the planned project.

When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.
Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.
The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.

A bird airlifted ashore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild.
The water rail was put on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being nursed back to health by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the spread of smoke, however, one was able to make an emergency call.
After a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building.
The second person had to be carried.
The building, a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
In addition to this, there were also electrical machines for wood processing.
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.
There are a lot of patients.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.

The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Psychosocial aspects are important, too.
The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.

There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.
Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.
There are varying explanations.
Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.
Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.

Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.
But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.
He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.

The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.
Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.
That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.

They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.
Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.

On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" intended for drug smuggling.
Three suspects were detained in relation to the discovery, with eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
"These cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig through under the radar," said the US Attorney for the District of Southern California, Laura Diffy, at a press conference held in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
Due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel, investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border.
The tunnel has a cross-section measuring 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres across.
Two of the suspects were detained in conjunction with the cocaine find.
Since 2006, eight tunnels of this type have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Squad in San Diego.

Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.
After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.
Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.
There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.
Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.

Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.
It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."
The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.

Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.
But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies.
"He's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.

At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.
Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.
Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.
On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.
"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.

Her agency agency advises people on the topic of 'growing old'.
Therefore the experience of the Stiftung Warentest consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept inconveniences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment.
Nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barrier-free.
However, it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, even if it is as beautiful as ever.
Waltraud Ries had to go through this experience herself.
You could of course install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the cobbled path up to the door of the apartment, featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hindrance.

On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder while replacing a broken external sensor and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a broken heating sensor on the external facade of a guest house.
As he was climbing the ladder, which was resting on the roof guttering, it slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete below.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken by the "Christophorus 6" rescue helicopter to the Salzburg Regional Hospital.

The so-called 'German Mass', with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des heiliges Opfers der Messe" (Songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the mass), D 872, is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schubert, dating from 1826, at at the time it was written was considered almost revolutionary.
Patron Johan Philipp Neumann has in mind for the mass to be performed as part of the church services.
Under the directorship of Hermann Schneider, the choir will be accompanied by the wind ensemble of the Frohsinn Tennenbronn Music Society, and by Noemi Lokodi on the organ.

Schiltach's town master mason, Roland Grießhaber, explained the peculiarities of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing to the Town Council.
Larger vehicles, for example those that transport long logs, would be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic, without having to block the railway line.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.
Furthermore, when the Hauptstrasse is blocked, the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel, argued Haas.
The councillors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could, on the other hand, bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The Administrative Department had Deutsche Bahn's reconstruction plans investigated by the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg will be straightforward.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck.
According to the councillors, the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority, as the town of Schiltach would "bear the brunt of the cost" for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck, since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work.
The committee considers the reconstruction of the "Vor Heubach" and 'Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn, to be unproblematic.
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.
New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.
It's like the mystery of why people are gay.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.
Children need stability and certainty.
But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.
When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.
When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.
When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.
After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.
But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."

"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'
The two towers, measuring around 157 metres, extend into the heavens, making it Europe's second tallest church building.
However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two ornate church towers realise that there is much to discover beneath the cathedral.
The meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre, right at the cathedral.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze has participants take a glance into a dark, 15-metre shaft on the upper parking level.
The next stop on the tour is the praetorium, where participants once again descend to the depths.
Schulze has one more surprise.
Once he has collected the key from the information desk, he leads the group to a 16-metre, accessible shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish congregation built their bath deep into the ground in order to reach the groundwater essential for ritual washing.
To this day the differing water levels caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read at the lower end of the Mikwe, the origins of which trace back to the eighth century.
Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.
Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysician, and to a certain extent his novels and stories also feature recurring themes.
Some titles have been released by the Heyne Verlag publishing house,the 'Haffman's cassette' featuring 118 stories was distributed by Zweitaudenseins.
Perhaps he was crazy, or perhaps drugs had affected his brain.
He wrote a 'Theology of the Computer' and questioned what separates humans from the machine, the creator from the creation.
That is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The latter story is now particularly significant.

Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.
The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.
The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.
She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.
Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.

It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.
A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
All the victims were seriously injured, with one man almost losing a leg.
The victims were said to have belonged to the competing gang, the Hell's Angels.
At the time, a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The Federal Supreme Court repealed the verdict following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred the case back to the District Court for a re-trial.
The central point of focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and third parties, which the police had intercepted.
This also applies in the case of the victims.
When asked, Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor's Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial.
A further eleven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial.

In the days before the Kilbig Autumn Folk Festival, when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard, a small corner wall with balustrades was installed to stabilise and relieve the static load on the old natural stone wall, which is more than one hundred years old.
A decision is expected to be made in the coming year.
Following the renovation, plastering and planting of trees in the old internal school yard, within the two wings of the 1912 school, as a subsequent measure the boundary wall, which is in need of refurbishment, must be renovated from the ground up within the foreseeable future.
Deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage, however, at present the wall is not in danger of collapse.
A secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils, and this is the purpose of the current fortification work.

Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.
The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
The concept is not a universal hit.
It was not something people wanted.
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.
There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.
Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.

Before Friday's Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart, the 'Ultras' responded with silence - initially.
The south stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and the loudest - of BVB fans stand, was initially unusually quiet: No singing and no battle cries.
And right at the front, on the stand, a single large flag with the text "Stadium Ban Section" blew in the wind.
And as soon as the vociferous request for "derby winners stand up" came from the south stand upon kick-off, everything was back to normal.
The previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days.
As a result, BVB Chairman Hans Joachim Watzke had invited the heads of the Dortmund Ultras fan group to his office - and if Watzke's words are to be believed, this was a rather uncomfortable meeting for the fan representatives.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from organising choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
In addition, the Ultras were given the option of several different punishments - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept.

ESA makes decision on major space missions: Missions costing billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years.
These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency, ESA.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should greatly advance research.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should greatly advance research.
At the beginning of September, the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, of which five have now made it onto the short list.
Over the coming days, a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, four main questions were chosen by the ESA, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, initiated in 2007, are to find the answers.
The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in proverbial darkness.
A large infra-red telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life exist there?
In order to pursue this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail.
The possibilities are, however, limited - Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro.

How does the solar system function?
This question should also provide information regarding the preconditions for the origins of life.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the ESA has already approved an M-class mission (for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro) to address this matter.
The probe is to be launched in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
What are the basic physical laws of the Universe?
Outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature, as known to us, are still valid there.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
Thus far, researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-mission, planned to commence in 2020.

Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission place: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which among other things would research black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "prism", a mission for the measurement of cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which would find and investigate planets similar to Earth.

Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.
The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.

Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.

Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.
The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.
"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.

New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.

Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.
He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.
Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.
He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.

Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.

The former German soldier who, following two tours in Afghanistan, had worked as a doorman, made a confession within the context of a plea-bargaining procedure.
According to the confession, on five occasions he got to know women via Internet or telephone contacts, who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks.
Appearing before the court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion.

Once a psychiatric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psychiatric condition, and thus on his limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a full confession.
The court did not have to question any more of the female victims.
As an official from the Criminal Investigation Department reported, following the first conviction achieved using telephone surveillance measures, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified.

At the end, Parish Counsellor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was agreed on by a clear majority.
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.
"We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.

The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.
The cause of the blast was not known, he said.

Further attractions on Sunday are the corn maze, the craft market and sheep shearing.
Specially for children, there is a petting zoo, "straw bouncy castle", tractor driving (under supervision) and tractor surfing.
George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.

At present, fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their Abitur examinations (equivalent to A levels).

Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.
The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.

Recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation, the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared: "The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession.
For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected.

History is a great teacher.
By raising the living standards of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production.

Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics
However, the judge's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges.
"Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor, fearful for his safety, would stop carrying out the procedure, the group said.

The drop, coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35, could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "core gardening age group," according to the HTA's study, which was reported by the Financial Times.
Greater London, where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, has Britain's lowest spend per household on gardening products.

Her party is calling on the Harburg district authority to deploy empty houses to accommodate the refugees.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the over-crowding in the initial reception centres are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help, as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.

Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass, the beauty of the stroke in cricket.
I never had a conversation with him like that.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him.
It wasn't until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying 'I love you, I love you, I love you.
He's still very good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
So when I became very, very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms, my doctor said, 'You've got to be radical.
So I went on a big fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
Nobody likes eating carrots.

Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985, whilst being a star, being on television and it was really difficult.
Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.
My family were very uncomfortable about it.
Introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture, Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.
So I was very frightened of it.
Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.
Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.

There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.""
There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.""
There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained.
"A little voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer.""
Instead, the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me went, "Oh, thank God".

Kenya registers civil servants to target 'ghost workers'
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013.

All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise, a government statement said.
"This exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of 'ghost workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.

Children need roots and wings
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child.
Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today's Trutnov.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station; take the train to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school; and then make the return journey home.
In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station; take the train to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school; and then make the return journey home.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.
In the school year of 1968/69, these classes were accommodated in Petershausen, in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded, the only school left in the locality was the primary school.
In order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school, the then dean, Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen continued to grow, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982 onwards, could move into the present-day building, which has since been extended, after Richter took his retirement.
"Mayor Götz was a great friend of the school," recalls Richter, with gratitude.
"One has to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84 year-old.

In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen-and-women were greeted by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had ridden off the start-line in Bad Vilbel on his own bike, and the boss of the municipal company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
"Such cakes only the local women can make," praised the rider from Aulendiebach, at the same time as he ordered another slice.
At the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnasium club, the riders could acquire cold drinks.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from Operettas and Musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.

His pick-up truck, in which he used three telephones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15-strong Hessen Police team; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports, also needed a check.
As the riders set out again on the road, they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort: "Bye!"
"It was very nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they shouted, as they waved goodbye.
On the second day of the tour program, the riders would call at the stopping points of Birstein; Wächtersbach; and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern.

A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power.
A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account that disavowed the post.
The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge.
His high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.

Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of upmarket housebuilder Berkeley, on Monday said: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has reverted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013," adding that this offered a "stable operating environment."
However, a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London estate agent Foxtons last week warned that April's Mortgage Market Review, which introduced tougher lending rules, would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mortgage approvals in July, further suggesting the housing market is cooling.
In June the company reported it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £380m, on revenues up 18 per cent to £1.6bn.
Speaking on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations.
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.

Having heard only ballads, Ailinn was hard pressed to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever have been set to music.
Music was the expression of love.
Except maybe to people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anybody, but he delighted in this song.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
She shook her head in disbelief, blotting out Kevern's vision.
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?

The populace weeps to sentimental ballads, gorges on stories of adversity overcome, and professes to believe ardently in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old brutishness retain a pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban conurbations, evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home, in the workplace, on our roads and even on our playing fields.

The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead
He was on his first day at school (Russians start school aged 7) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara.
After one explosion he thought she was dying.
His dad Vladimir, who scooped up his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mother had died.
In fact, Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds, in turn believing her son had perished.
After their reunion she said: 'I wept with joy.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to be crowned a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie.

Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.

Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better.
I got back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.

The boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
As the siege was underway, he was pictured trapped inside the gym, sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again.
I would never ever go there again and please don't ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture.

He is a boy, he likes sports but he can't take part because of his knee.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.

The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.
The baby who was carried poignantly to safety by a special forces commando
Saved: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces commando (left).
Terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother, ten year old older sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl, who he named Kristina after the daughter he lost.

When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually, and unaccountably, upset.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost every case, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once dubbed "miraculous," but now known to be mortally dangerous.
Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
But such complacency is misplaced.
There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet.
The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.
A quick glance at the reports from the courts, where those affected often turn for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Now she has two children in their 20s.
It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seals, even brake linings in cars.
A report from Goddard Consulting, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, might have been exposed unawares.
In 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be disturbed by something as innocuous as "strong currents of air."
While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given "a clean bill of health," it is now accepted £1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament, upgrading electrics and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Benches at Westminster.
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
One person who has never been able to pinpoint his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever.
Being a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he took exercise and was breathing hard.
After all, his patient was decades older, and had worked directly asbestos.
After all, his patient was decades older, and had worked directly asbestos.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell, a probe, equipped with a camera, was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
I hadn't worried about it too much to be honest.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes," he says.
But many staff, walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or eating in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott frequently did) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients, but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos was frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its marvellous insulating and flame-retarding properties.
Up and down the country, in myriad chemistry lessons, pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The impact of diagnosis, knowing that the disease is incurable, is huge.
"It takes a while to sink in," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was at the surgery for two weeks.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with.
Mesothelioma is particularly pernicious, because it is the mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills.
Most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can become embedded in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can become embedded in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in treating mesothelioma.
It is by its nature invasive from the very beginning.
The normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mesothelioma.
Meanwhile the cancer "is not very responsive to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but does not cure.
But in the end they all die.
Happily, some patients do live far, far beyond expectations.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still battling on.
After contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers.
He had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active.
"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just rang them up and they saw me," Graham admits.
Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments.
But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation.
"It has been known that asbestos is noxious to health since 1898," says Morgan.
Insurance records may have been lost.
In response, this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced.
The law has created a £350m pot of money, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.
In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.
In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.
Even Mike Penning, then Works and Pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."
"People are suffering so much, and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill's second reading in December last year.

This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent.

Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kongers a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating committee tightly controlled by Beijing.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters.

It was not only the gladiators that stood ankle deep in the mud at the park during Rheinbach's first Roman day.
The appeal of the event was so great that it attracted more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain and autumn chill, and who were completely taken in by the historical show.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial arts group from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which, every time it stopped raining, seized the opportunity to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the soft sand covered arena.
The owner of gladiators "Leonidas" proved himself to be a humorous and expert presenter, who sent men, one after one, into the ring for a heroic duel in a variety of gladiatorial genres.
What was particular impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who went up against the "Secutor" with a cast-net, trident and dagger, and who, after a short fight, knocked the guys to the ground.

It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception.
District, Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Businesses" state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back-to-back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose at a faster clip, 4.3 percent, than local levies, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from firms.
Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies" real estate values, researchers say, which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-1 percent growth.
While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well.
The recent rebound in business tax revenue cannot all be attributed to the recovering real estate market.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Maryland.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, in line with Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year, the law could push the state's business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017.
If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year, the law could push the state's business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017.
Researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year, with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.

His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin didn't mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory "Novorossiya," or "New Russia," a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire.
"We must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there," he said.
The Kremlin spokesman's intercession to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.

In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.
Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.

Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Date' With Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.

But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.

Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
And these numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.

While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.

But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.

Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".

Archaeologists from the Roman Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Boulevard is being constructed , said museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Historians have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves, which probably belonged to the church, has also been discovered.

According to this, the disputed private arbitration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system which citizens trust," stated the responsible EU Commissioner, Cecilia Malström, when introducing it.

Plans for reform of the current arbitration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
For the first time, a second instance is also provided for.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by adversaries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax payers, make national laws null and void, or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards.

The German Secretary of State for the Economy, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, referred to the plans as major progress.
The French government, too, welcomed Malström's plans.
Small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, they said.
The issue of investor protection, however, has to date not been discussed with the USA.
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club (now Luxor) in Cologne.
Beside him stands a flip chart on which the shy-seeming folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt-tip pen.
Beside him stands a flip chart on which the shy-seeming folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, some 40 people, is virtually mesmerised by Stevens's performance.
Referring to different places, which each time he marks on the map, he talks about the stories behind his meticulously and subtly contrived songs.
One year later the New York-based musician returns to his series.
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with a variety of effects and echoes.
Long since moved on from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectacles with neon headbands and huge fluorescent stage decorations.
Since March the theatre has primarily presented "Carrie and Lowell".
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit spellbound in their seats, the clearly more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to folk.
Without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
Only with his encore does Stevens give his modest thanks, play a few of his older songs acoustically and finally take a bow to thunderous applause.
He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.
But one group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living.

As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.

But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.
He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.

But frustrations were on the rise.

In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.

Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.
Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.

More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.

While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).

Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.
The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.

Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.

A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.

In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
That's not to say there won't be effects, however.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:

As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.

While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?

The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.

The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.

After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.

After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."

It was a very bad tackle with two legs.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.

With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.

I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.

For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.

Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.

McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.
Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.

Property entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the Middle Franconian town of Eckental for people who do not have much money.
Property entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the Middle Franconian town of Eckental for people who do not have much money.
"I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays," says the 44-year-old in an interview.
What solution are you offering?
A totally standard three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs little space.
It facilitates integration.
Each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers.

Then the houses can easily be converted for different uses.
What are the costs?
Gildner: I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations.
The sword of Damocles threatening special building projects, and parking space regulations, always make it complicated.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
Gildner: The truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany, but it is luxury accommodation that has been built, which hardly anybody can afford any longer.

Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
In parallel, checks on the Hungarian border remain in place.
It is equally clear "that obvious signals are needed," says the minister.
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration, and not over the Austrian-Slovenian border either.
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany, and also potentially establish corridors for the refugees.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Sloveina intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary.
"Every member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.

In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.

There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.

Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.

Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.

Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.

The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.

The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.

Brazil's Pediatric Society of Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diets
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
According to this a "gable roof with an off-centre ridge and roof overhang" will be constructed.
Therefore an "exemption" is necessary, since the development plan allows no "exceptions" with regard to roof pitch - while the Bernried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemptions.
In the next step of the project, the planning application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the district administration for review.
At the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The changes were triggered by the resignation of Dr Andreas Eder, who has been clinical director of the Schongau clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
Fisher is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
In the transitionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team, if the Board of Management agrees to this, will run both establishments, and in the next year the former miners' hospital in Peissenberg, which still has over 35 beds, will finally be closed after almost 140 years.
Thus far the district has planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing restoration of the Weilheim hospital is finished.
District administrator Jochner-Weiss, who is also Chairman of the Board of Management, contradicts rumours that the building, which is owned by the Federal Association for Miners, will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.

Hungary had cordoned off its borders for refugees the previous day.
Moreover, new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant.
Moreover, new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explains, "They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility".
These people are there, they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something.
On Tuesday police counted 366 people that they had picked up.
The new Hungarian laws classify climbing and damaging the border fences as criminal offences.
This has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those convicted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and extradition from the country.
Furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany.

"We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday, when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with suitcases," says Mayor of Wernstein Alois Stadler.
Because Germany had unexpectedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees, their journey had come to a halt in Wernstein," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and together with two other helpers and their cars chauffeured the stranded people over the border to Passau.
The stranded train passengers had changed trains in Wels on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Passau after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended, in an attempt to cross the border anyway.
But the regional train was stopped before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight.
The government has engaged the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got to grips with the chaos in the Traiskirchen reception centre.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first achievement.
In order to meet this figure, accommodation for another 35,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to be provided for by the states and 15,000 by the federal government.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help.

But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really down to earth, she's so much fun to be around," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.

After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).

Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.

Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.

In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.

It could have been very lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.
Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.
As a result he ran into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle into the Ford Fiesta stopped in front of it.

Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a cheat.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.
He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?

Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.

Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.
"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.

The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge – the German Chancellor is determined to accept it.
According to the predictions of the Federal Minister of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year, and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees.

According to various forecasts between 350,000 (estimation by the Ministry of buildings) and 400,000 (estimation by the Pestel Institute) homes will be needed annually – and in fact for the next five years.
In the view of the Pestel Institute this is far too little: 80,000 social dwellings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of €6.4 billion per year.
Academics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work.
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society, and also to the self-esteem of the immigrant says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
While in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years, this was reduced in November 2014 to three months, as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of domicile.
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work-related language courses.
Thus, in Thränhardt's view, the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration.
If the need for teachers increases sharply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity, for example by allowing for more technical colleges.
In the states, pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes.
However they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of these, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or those with long-term refugee status from studying – the only exception up to now was Berlin: Senator for the Interior Frank Henkel (CDU) has however now abandoned his stance.
The students should receive a grant immediately.

The founding of an Islamic welfare organisation, which looks after new arrivals in a professional manner, is also important.
Thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to concede certain control options.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany.
In the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can cope," he told the Tagesspiegel.
A soon-to-be published study by the TU in Munich documents that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatised in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer among other things from so-called flashbacks, difficulties in breathing, dizziness, palpitations and fear of death.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, nervousness and emotional numbness.
In addition, it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not.

Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament

The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
A few years ago, FC Bayern was apparently close to committing to Spain's superstar Xavi, who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, twice club world champion, twice European champion, one time world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breath-taking.
In the summer the then 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Qatar and the al-Sadd Sport Club.

A quick reminder: in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over at FC Bayern.
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi covered the entire distance on the turf for Barça in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bayern, knocked the Reds out (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the premiere class triumph.

His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age: "The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising, which is loud.

The EU commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neurotoxin.
Once the limit has been doubled, however, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
