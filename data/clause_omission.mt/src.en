When in danger, a rat or roach will run away. Does it mean they experience fear, too?
I believe that animals have feelings, as well as other modes of awareness, although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date. For that matter, we haven't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness.
In contrast to this, Antonio Damasio supposes, for instance, that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations. Jaak Pankseep says something similar, but his focus is more on the brainstem.
Pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it, as well, in both cases. But how can we determine whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways?
A roach's response to danger is flight. Does it experience fear?

The novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject. Despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with the new project he is working at, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who spent twenty years of his life in Congo and crossed Amazon.
Introduced by Félix Romeo, the writer faced a public whose time flew away when the Peruvian author, started to recall with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humour, the way he discovered his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure and the pleasure of reading." This is "living beyond life", as he put it in. He explained why orderly basis in writing permits "to remove the lack of inspiration," through an intense work of documentation, editing and revising. He underlined how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas affected his vocation and said that the "images of memory" are the foundation from which his stories spring up.
The Hispanic-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people's lives. I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and ephemeral entertainment experience," said Vargas Llosa who, also supported that "the literature has a strong impact and pushes people to be nonconformist." So he suggested the writers "not to give into frivolity" and to "take the responsibility" of their own vocation.

Jose Luis Garci, inspired by the novel Episodios Nacionales of Banito Pérez Galdós, recreates in Sangre de mayo the spanish popular riot against the French. This is the most ambitious work of his filmography, with a nearly 15 million euro budget.
Great fan of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims this shooting realized "a dream of his childhood". He likes to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years earlier, had commissioned him to shoot a film to commemorate the second centenary of the Madrid 2nd of May. This was the desire expressed by the Community of Madrid. The director agreed on condition that the story grounded on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a "stunned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the fight for independence led people to a huge delay in development during the reign of Ferdinand VII" said Garci.
However, the director regrets not having received equal funds of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice compared to Sangre de mayo. So far, it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan, he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, his career-long collaborator.
A certain number of interpreters, some of which fall within the cast of Sangre de mayo, repeat in front of his video-camera. It is the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.

The conduct of the criminal prosecution of János Zuschlag and his companions will be started on 8th October.
The methodology - which has been published by the investigating authority, too - was to use bills of costs with unreal performance in order to access the awarded tender funds. This way the associations never met the agreed undertakings.
The imaginative fillers of the invoices went also too far when they indicated Pigal Kft. in the documents. It is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accusation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
The degree of VAT, which has been shown in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the foundation Jobb Jövőért, was also incorrect since the service of the firm should have been increased by VAT of 15%, instead of the indicated 25%. Additionally, the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machine-made invoices, while the reviewed bills were manually prepared.
The invoice-issuers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosecution procedure. This activity was not included in the services carried out by the firm originally dealing with investment consulting.
The fake nature of the bills issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont was disclosed due to formal deviations such as inappropriate billing format and forged stamp.
The forgers did not even pay attention to the fact that the Nyíregyháza based HIB Kft. was under liquidation at the time (2001) when a group from Fiatal Városért Egyesület allegedly had lunch there. The insolvency practitioner denied having issued the document.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued an invoice of about four million forints for on the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták. This invoice was issued to the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért.
Biogate Kft. - which is currently under liquidation - also cooperated with Zuschlag and his companions. In 2003 the company provided the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with invoices of roughly HUF 5 million with no real economic activity behind.
According to the data of the investigation, these bills were purchased by the Kiskunhalas-based Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
Still, he could take advantage of these undertakings; for his request, attorney Zsolt Szente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invoices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with Zuschlag, namely for Atlasz and Y-Generáció.

Approximately half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection. In Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the main causes of mortality.
Although the number of the Hungarians being infected by hepatitis can reach 100 000, only 7 000 of them are treated properly. The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected.
Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against viruses A and B by vaccination; but there is no vaccination against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear 2 or 3 weeks after having eaten the contaminated food; they are accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal problems, nausea.
The next sign is jaundice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye. Additional symptoms are: light coloured faeces, dark urine. Recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks.
Hepatitis C can also lead to serious problems: it may result in cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer if it is not treated.
30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the infected.
Benelux states help Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch bank - which is the first European financial institute in trouble due to the follow-through effect of the American lending crisis - by a partial state buyout. The three countries have agreed to inject EUR 11.2 billion into the banking and insurance company having Hungarian interests.
Within the Euro zone, Fortis is the first bank hit by the international financial crisis approaching in waves in the last 12 months. Thus, from a certain point of view, the decisions made may be considered precedent.
Considering the current stock prices, the entire market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion. However, company directors say this does not reflect reality.

On its 10th birthday Google can admit: it is there in the people's pocket, as well as above their head, in the sky. Google knows where people go on vacation, what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are interested in.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google was to collect further personal information about the users. It is necessary to maintain the Google founders' original aim, namely: "to create a system for all the information of the world", he added.
Answering the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like "What shall I do tomorrow?" , or "What type of jobs suit me best?". However, software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient.
Using the 2-year-old Personalized Search function, users can store their own surfing histories, they can review what they were looking for, what kind of links they clicked on before. In the long term, it can provide the users with personalized findings. The function called Recommendations will be based on the same logic: it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier.
Nevertheless, it has been confirmed that all the searched terms are recorded and - where appropriate - those can even be transferred to third parties. In such cases nothing protects the privacy of the Internet users.
The best example for that is the concerted action against some Brazilian paedophiles; Google transferred the Brazilian government some information from one of its social networking pages, called Orkut. The data supplied helped the government identify several paedophiles.
As it seems, there are controversial opinions on Google. It is attacked by those who fear of giving out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life would be diminished by using the services provided by Google. Thus, they rather represent the resisting group of conservative multinational companies.
One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications. Furthermore, the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - comparing to the official software giant's practice - looks more available, youthful and cool.
Web 2.0 is about a collaboration to intentionally leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels. Though the degree of this act can be various, depending on the user, the main point is the same: we show ourselves to the world.
An average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or Xanga, they can even link them to other services like Twitter or the music list maker last.fm, then those can be connected to a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, users can create blogs that automatically update the recently uploaded photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
We can read about several stories like this: the girl - checking the plenty of photos uploaded in the morning by common friends - finds out where her untrustworthy boyfriend spent his previous night. Or another one: an employee might lose his job just because he shared his opinion on the management in his blog. One consequence can be definitely drawn: the definition of privacy has been revalued.
The number of those intentionally not registering to social networking sites is significant. This way they can avoid being discovered, Google's online applications from text editor to image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever.
The company - with its value of USD 156 billion - is worth more than IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion). In addition, the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever-increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software developers a serious headache.
Nevertheless, critics can also find the disturbing counterpoints: the management completely rejected the employees' objection, which burst out because the fee of the company's kindergarten had been doubled. The daily canteen - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management. However, all these are nothing compared to the fact that Google bowed before the Chinese government in 2006 and - according to their agreement - the company has filtered all search results that offend good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be advertised in advance, only when they are ready to be used. Still, the coming months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world: some people predict that the book and magazine scanning and archiving project of Google will soon reach such proportions that it will have to face the Supreme Court. Others have fear of the Health system, which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us, including our previous medical findings, physicians and problems.
Finally, the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sci-fi writers of the next generation. Cory Doctorow's popular novel, Scroogled applies Orwell's style in the description of a future where a person can be pictured terrifyingly well only by using Google data.

Referring to the results of the compromise, Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury declared: the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient, but further steps are still to be taken. According to Pelosi, it is not about rescuing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy.
Now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the USD 700 billion can be used in a way that USD 250 billion shall instantly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday. One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mortgage-backed securities. An additional amount of USD 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used.
Pursuant to the law, the Secretary of the Treasury is entitled to apply a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other types of "poisonous" credits.
Henry Paulson declared: pursuant to the law, the required assets are provided depending on the situation; it might be an aid of USD 700 billion urgently needed by the American financial system, due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets, or the insurance of those, or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes.

Sociologists have predicted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong. Nevertheless, secularization, educational results, the settling of Germans from the Eastern and Northern part of the country to the developing regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the CSU loyalty of the voters.

"Who, with whom? Party chairmen are reserved considering coalition issues" is the title of the article in which the Vienna-based conservative daily newspaper is analyzing the confusing domestic political situation developed after the Austrian elections.

In her message that she addressed to the plenum, Lívia Járóka of Fidesz, Representative of the European People's Party called attention for the educational segregation since it is one of the most serious infringement affecting Roma children. Moreover, this is the largest barrier to their prosperity.
The earlier a young Roma student starts attending school, the bigger their chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget.
She also said that in order to instantly accelerate the processes of school desegregation, it is necessary to guarantee an objective- and action-oriented cooperation within the European Union. To accomplish this goal, it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
Dick developed a much cheaper method ten years ago: on the basis of the customer's identification number the type of drugs purchased by the customer in the last 18 months can be easily detected, thus the programme can draw the consequences by its own regarding the illnesses the applicant suffers as well as their health condition.

The army has enough igniter cord to wind the whole of Czech Republic. But they will expire in only two years.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnicians approached by MF Dnes, will face the same problem in a few years: They will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old igniter cords that are currently "cheaply" purchased.

Solarworld came in 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The water in the rivers is oil-brown and reeks like a petrol station. Billions of litres of leaked crude oil have destroyed the natural environment of Ogoniland in Nigeria.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to paddle six hours to get to water inhabited by fish. Ogoniland, in the heart of the Niger delta, is one of the most contaminated regions in the world.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat churns up a brown swill; if you put your hand in the water it comes out coated in oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees stick out from the ground like black liquorice sticks. The odd palm among the mangroves hangs its frond despondently.
The flocks of birds ubiquitous in wetlands are nowhere to be seen. As soon as the outboard motor falls silent, a devastating quiet descends over the former paradise that now stinks like a petrol station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari, sombrely. "We are living with a permanent hazard to health."
The region of the Ogoni has been a contested battlefield for decades. More than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe made their way to the region. In the 80s, the first wave of resistance was organised around the author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed. It was here that the Shell company had to stop production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is prohibited from returning to Ogoniland. While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped every day from the delta region as a whole - which is an area three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipeline - the oilfields in Ogoniland lie fallow, the situation too unstable for the oil company.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames rise from the water like bizarre sculptures. The heads of boreholes are far too affectionately referred to as "little Christmas trees."
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have flown into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years. Year on year, that is the same amount of oil that rushed into the sea off Alaska when the Exxon Valdez supertanker crashed 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history.
In 2008, the US academic Richard Steiner accused Shell of applying significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than in the rest of the world. The rate of defects in pipelines alone was "several times higher than elsewhere."
Human figures emerge from the mangrove swamps, that from a distance look deserted, oil-covered outside garages. The figures are stark naked and covered to the neck in oil.
Under one of the many barrels - some connected to pipes, others scattered at random over the ground - there is a a flickering fire. An illegal mini refinery.
The illegal cooks can still undercut the absurdly low diesel prices of 40 Euro cents per litre. They get their raw material for nothing.
The material comes from "bunkerers" who tap the pipeline network all the way across Ogoniland. Over the entire Niger delta, experts estimate the country loses at least 16 millions litres of crude oil a day in this way.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that was forced to land at the beginning of November appear to have had considerably more luck than anyone realised. During its investigations, the Australian air safety authority identified a serious safety issue in the engines of some A380 planes - and is now warning of a possible construction defect.
The alleged defect would have serious consequences. In a statement published on Thursday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) revealed that the defect could potentially cause fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil hose connection.
Germany all in white. There has been overnight snowfall across most of the country.
The winter freeze in Germany. In freezing temperatures, almost the entire country was covered in snow on Wednesday night - causing traffic chaos in many areas.

"In spite of his pro American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP won't doubt in capitalizing any indication that the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored actions of the USA that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the USA," indicates.
After the important increase in the votes and experienced deputies in the recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PP is already thinking to the general elections, is there and advance or not?, the outlook is more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles the ones received during the Catalan elections.

To go from 45 saving banks with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that does not have comparison in history, reducing the number of organizations to a 62% so that they are much bigger to fulfil Basilea , he underlined.
Olavarrieta recognized that there is "a series of opinions rather pessimistic on the slowness of the process" that demonstrates "a lack of seriousness and reason," because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must fulfil the term before the end of year."
The expulsion presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behaviour is or is not unsportsmanlike and if, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
Anyway, the debate deals with if that type of behaviour not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions fraud is committed; then, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sport regulation, but they seem to elude its sense.

World championships 2018-2022: Fifa appoints organising countries.
Torment due to suspected corruption. On Thursday, the executive committee of Fifa will appoint countries to organise World Cup matches in 2018 and 2022, an eminently politcal choice, where influence and lobbying battles are liable to take precedence of technical criteria.
One thing is certain; the 2018 edition of the Fifa competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the game (4 candidates, Great Britain, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Belgium-The Netherlands; Angleterre, Russie, Espagne-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The only certainty: The BCE would keep its principal rate of interest unchanged at 1%, historically the lowest since May 2009.

The Orwellian prophecy proved completely true, since being able to be completely controlled thanks to the telephone, the hotel visited, the motorway taken and so on, the citizen became a total victim of the eye of power.
It is true, as George Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret and can never be discovered; it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is a secret devoid of secrecy, because it is in the public domain, but to disclose, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Cliton were empty secrets, means taking away all her power.
The operation transparency is appreciable and appreciated at its just value: developing countries and the civil society are doing the same and at the same level of precision. les pays en développement et la société civile aimeraient que tous les pays développés fassent de même avec un même niveau de précision.
The European Commission, for example, took for its reference the year 2009; international finance is maintained and it is adding 150 milions over 3 years as fast start finance. les financements internationaux sont maintenus, et elle y ajoute 150 millions sur trois ans au titre des financements fast start.
Clearly, this is difficult to justify; the effort is not coparable. l'effort n'est pas comparable.
If the custom of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often projects linked to emissions which rely on more efficient technologies) it is fallacious to call a Euro which one will recoup as a donated Euro..In addiiton, only the cost of a loan to the lender country should be taken into accunt as its commitment (equal to the rate of interest).
But France need only reason that it "observes" it commitment of 420 million Euros making 91.5% of loans (399.8 million Euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million Euros) - see European Union document for your own verifcation. elle "respecte" son engagement de 420 millions d'euros en faisant 91,5% de prêts (389,8 millions d'euros) et 8,5% de dons (36,1 millions d'euros) - voir le document de l'UE pour vérifier par vous-même.
Summing up, France operates, in its fast start finance, double blackmail: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action over time and the other hand, on the reality of the financial effort. d'une part sur l'évolution de l'action dans le temps et d'autre part sur la réalité de l'effort financier.
But above all, France could promote the discussions about long-term financing stakes (another crucial chapter currently being discussed); it is not possible to avoid the question of "additionality" or of the method of accountancy of loans. on n'échappera pas à la question de "l'additionalité" ou du mode de comptabilisation des prêts.

The wonderful Petr Čech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year's European Championship. And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Crowns.

Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
Moreover, the families of obese children do not practise sports. However, this concerns a majority of families of current schoolchildren - only 15% of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week.
The research took place at the end of last year's school year; it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout Bohemia.

Our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
It promised to shift the old Need For Speed racing series in a new direction; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre.
For a while, you try to overtake a number of competitors (basically a regular race); then you try to beat the time (standard stopwatch race); or you are in a duel with a single rival.
It actually turns out to be good for the game, because this feature does not get to be boring; within what was already said, it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic, you sometimes lightly touch the other car. Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
It makes no difference when you get to them; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose.
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story.
The sound is all right; the soundtrack is a matter of taste.

She explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question: "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
Whether the budget will be slim and frugal; which fields will be given preference; which countries will be supported more and which less; all of that is on the coming agenda.
She thinks numerous factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; together with low support from the Czech side.
"The number of such institutes will be growing; it will be a highly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
To the wide public, IMB is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is seen as a highly temporary one, yet it was founded over a hundred years ago.
From the very beginning, the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people. It was one of the first world companies to abolish all discrimination, which rendered it with great selection.
She has been working in IMB for thirty years; she is currently a Director of Sales, Marketing, and Strategy.
"IBM is not a technology firm; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology," George Colony of Forrester Research consultation company adds.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies; five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Price.
Not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period. For example, IBM failed with its own operating system OS/2; Prodigy on-line services; and IBM PCjr computers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars. During the same time, it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent; company's net earnings have been growing continuously.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York, a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation" was quite complicated.
It took the name of IBM in 1924. Originally, this was a brand used for company's branches in Canada and South America.

After assist with Jágr, he scored the third goal; consequently, his shot was touched into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
Czech Montreal defenseman, Jaroslav Špaček, did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left in the second period due to an upper body injury.
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, the Yugoslavian regime turned West, which caused significant limitations to trips to Yugoslavia for Czech tourists.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel, as an individual, to, for example, the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from the country was necessary; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
A foreign currency assurance was essential for travels to the West. It was not granted to politically unreliable people, who were not allowed to travel at all.
Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible; without the currency assurance, it was not possible to obtain financial means (Western currency) for travelling West.
Right at the beginning of 1990, visa requirements for neighbouring West European countries were cancelled. This started a huge wave of short-term visits of chiefly Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible Czech Crown. After decades, our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies.
Since 1997, increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts.
By the end of 1990s, Czechs did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries, except for the USA. This made our travelling even easier.
The next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 2000. High demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will reach twelve exotic destinations.
For nearly five months, Czech football has had no President. There exists a risk that Ivan Hašek's successor, the head of Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which is to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
Hašek resigned from his function in June. When leaving, he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
This was fully shown on September 16, when a new President was to be chosen.
The question is: How to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid mate?
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; that would completely deny the two-chamber concept," Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations.
He believes the new President will be known in Nymburk; he also hopes that in the future, the candidates will cooperate constructively.
"Football will be back on the happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," a Jablonec functionary says. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels.
Some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match.
An extra flight that was to take, among others, the Vice Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure. An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch.
A lot is in the game: Government grants; football trustworthiness; and the planned ČSTV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following Sazka's financial problems.
At the moment, Paclík's strongest disagreement with Pelta is based on the latter's connection to Roman Berbr, President of Pilsen's regional football association. Berber is a man of controversial reputation, who is, behind the scenes, known as powerful lobbyist, capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates.
He is hinting at the fact that some years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation; Pelta came out without a sentence.
"And how would we look in the eyes UEFA and FIFA," Paclík said. He is now more detached from his former statement saying he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became President."
He refers to his skills from management of private companies; since last summer, he has been managing the Pilsen team that, with his support, celebrated its first league triumph in May.
"To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, leading to disgusting situations," Paclík said. He does not hide his antipathy for, e.g. Sparta's Director, Daniel Křetínský.
He decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment. A two-month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context.
"They feel it's high time someone leads the association," claims the man chiefly connected with the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association's executive board.
In the past, he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognises for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice President.
"This is too, is why some of them now doubt his true character," Pelta said about his rival. Pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations he announced in September.
"Nevertheless, I can still feel a strong support in the Czech chamber that elected me its Vice President, and can see I have achieved some clear successes," Rajchl said. Among his successes, he includes the saving of dozens of millions of Crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating TV contracts, and negotiations about the lottery law.
And swimming baths can be a real treat for the eyes if the builders have gone to the trouble. "You have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor."
Many of the heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, offer spectacular views. You can view all of Zurich from a rooftop bath or look out on the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor pool in St. Anton. And there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski piste.
Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld. The Aqua Dome in Ötztal looks like a UFO has just landed in the Alps.
A lot of thermal baths smell of sulphur. The Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa.
The smell comes from the hydrogen carbonate in the alkaline water. The water is almost black with silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a particular kind.
Iris Meder, however, was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places. When she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Luhatschowitz, she found the area sealed off.
The baths have already gone through three stages of construction. You will not only discover neo-Romanesque elements from the period after it was built in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in Alhambra style added around 1900.
For German citizens the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday. The survey was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November and 1001 people took part.
Many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading. According to the survey, one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation.
An architectural history with highs, lows and a happy-ever-after. Austria's Pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and was abandoned.
The new museum was to house the Fritz Wotruba Foundation's permanent collection, a café and a bookshop alongside contemporary art. An office building was also to be built.
The problems facing the latest alterations were much greater. The building was "an energy guzzler," says Krischanitz.
The 21er Haus is very much in the right place, as there has been a stroke of luck in town planning. The completely redesigned "main station quarter" with offices and residential properties is developing around the Schweizer Garten.
There may also be a second stroke of luck. The 21er Haus may be bolstered by another Krischanitz building - the collector Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Schweizer Garten.
As if the problems at home were not already enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant's past in the USA is now also catching up with it. Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank will pay 145 million dollars (106 million Euros) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
The coverage by some Turkish media has been like a slap in the face. "Germany's present on the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one article on the Haber X Turkish internet platform, which comments on the circumstances around the series of murders.
The Turkish press at the time complained mainly of the failure of German policy following the attacks. Helmut Kohl declined to visit the survivors in Mölln.
Catastrophe followed in October 2008. UBS faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
And just as things had calmed down and UBS looked like it would start to turn things around, along came a disastrous rogue trader. A single trader gambled away 1.7 billion Euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
The walls within are clad in marble behind vast leather armchairs. There is a large sign to the "Safe" next to the bank's logo.
It was in fact Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought in its first big profits - and then the debacle. No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became evident on 15 October 2008.
The fact that the two banks that went to form UBS complemented each other helped. One was a wealthy but sedate bank specialising in asset management in Zurich and the other was less wealthy, but much more internationalised.
And Wuffli ultimately may have made a critical error. "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
Commissioned management consultants, however, pointed out a weakness. In terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as "fixed income," UBS was far behind the very largest banks.
The announcement made US investors sceptical. "We are not an island. We are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
The investment legend, Warren Buffett, could only support such caution. In a CNBC interview, he said that it was not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis.
Rooks are considered problem birds in many places. Experts now say the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from cities.
Some like the birds, others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible. Crows have been part of the cityscape for hundreds of years, but residents complaining about the filth and noise the animals create are increasing in number in many communities.
The intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary. Rooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice morsel, but create tools themselves.

The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where according to the data obtained from the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PERP) the difference between the first and the second place of the governor's election is of only 27 percent, even without counting the votes that correspond to 879 of the total 6.074 minutes.
Thus, the partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that: the results of the records do not match; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president; or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
The total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position, case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial recount.

Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their in-game feats; a "YouTube for live gaming," in Business Insider's words.
The point is, YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was greeted with a yawn, a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor.

"We wanted to show a positive reaction", the defender Thomas Schrammel said, whose magnificent and skillful corner in the 14th minute set them on a winning course.
